<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>I have sought permission to inscribe
your Lordship’s name on this page, as a favour appropriate
to my work, under the considerations in which
it originated.</p>

<p>I began these translations, partly as a means of
acquiring an accurate knowledge of the Spanish language,
and partly as a relaxation from other studies
and pursuits, about the time when your Lordship, in
the course of your statesmanlike visit to America,
made, in 1842, a lengthened stay in Cuba, studying
the circumstances of those countries, which are soon,
perhaps, to take a yet more prominent place, than
they do at present, in the history of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span></p>

<p>The discussions I heard respecting that visit&mdash;for
it was then considered an extraordinary one&mdash;raised
in my mind many suggestions, as to the benefits
that must accrue to the public from the observations
of individual travellers. Accordingly as each one
might have his special object in view, his sphere of action
or opportunities of learning, so the knowledge he acquired
might be proportionately imparted. The community
at large had always evinced the greatest interest
in the accounts given by travellers of their
visits to foreign countries, as was shown by the
favourable reception uniformly given to their works.
Of these many that were published were well deserving
of the popularity they obtained, especially as with
regard to Spain there were several that left little for
any future writer to supply of ordinary information.
In one respect, however, all such works appeared to
me to be deficient, though their failure was almost
unavoidable, in the case of transient visitors, in their
being unable to convey any adequate idea of the state
of mental culture among the people they visited.</p>

<p>Yet this, to a philosophic reader, would be undoubtedly
the truest test of the state of civilization to
which any nation had attained. Such a reader would
not be contented with merely a recital of the every-day
occurrences of travelling, nor yet with general or
statistical information respecting any people, obtained
from ordinary sources. He would rather seek to
follow them into the occupations of private life and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
into their favourite courses of thought and feeling,
judging of these by the studies of their better classes
of society, in their hours of relaxation or for domestic
enjoyment. As the sagest of the Roman emperors,
M. Antoninus, observed, To know any people’s minds
and inclinations, we should examine their studies
and pursuits,&mdash;τὰ ἡγεμονικὰ αὐτῶν διάβλεπε, καὶ τοὺς
Φρόνιμους, διὰ μέν Φεύγουσιν, διὰ δὲ διώκουσιν.</p>

<p>Few persons going abroad for a short period, or
for a specific purpose, could be expected to acquire
such an intimate knowledge of the literature of any
country as to be able to render a satisfactory account
of it. Where, however, any one had the means and
the leisure to do so, that seemed to me the task most
worthy for him to undertake.</p>

<p>As a servant of the public, I considered this
more peculiarly a duty; and I therefore ventured, by
extending my studies, to attempt giving a comprehensive
view of Modern Spanish Poetry, and so complete
the representations of Spanish society and manners
given by other writers. This I thought best to
be done, first, by compiling some critical and biographical
notices of the principal modern poets; and,
next, by endeavouring to transfuse into English verse
the most favourable specimens of their productions,
by which the English reader might in some degree
be enabled to judge of their merits.</p>

<p>Such was the task I then set before me, the
results of which I now offer to the public as my contribution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
to the store of general knowledge. For
such a work there can be little merit claimed, except
that for patient industry. But as a naturalist or collector
of works of art patriotically endeavours to bring
home the most valuable productions or treasures of
other countries, so I trust that this work may also
be favourably accepted, as a praiseworthy attempt
to enrich our English literature with what was most
interesting in the Spanish.</p>

<p>I have relied on your Lordship’s approval of the
design, from your well-known anxiety and constant
efforts to improve the moral and social condition of
the people, by literary as well as by legislative means.
Sharing in the public respect for those efforts on their
behalf, and with much thankfulness for the sanction
afforded me, I have the honour to subscribe myself,</p>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>Those writers are very much mistaken who suppose, that,
consequent upon the long domination of the Moors in Spain,
there are to be found in Spanish literature any of the exuberances
of style which are considered the principal characteristics
of Eastern poetry. In all the Moorish ballads that
have been handed down to us, those characteristics, both in
thought and expression, abound as much as in the poems of
more Eastern nations. But in even the earliest Spanish
ballads, contemporary with the Moorish, a very decided difference
is to be observed, as they show, on the contrary, a
simplicity of expression and propriety of thought, which present
an extraordinary contrast, not only to the Moorish, but
also to the early poetry of other European countries. This
favourable distinction has continued to the present day. The
poetry of the Northern nations of Europe has been marked
by extravagances throughout, as contrary to common sense as
to good taste and nature. That of the French school has
been distinguished by an affectation, a sentimentality and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
straining after effect, to say nothing of its peculiar ribaldry
and licentiousness, all equally removed from the true feeling
of poetry. Even the Italians, in their poetical works, have
indulged in strange absurdities, the more remarkable from
the good taste that has pervaded their other works of genius.
It is only in English literature that we can find writers imbued
with the same vigour of thought and depth of poetic
feeling as the Spanish, and it is therefore only with them
that the latter can be classed in considering the relative
merits of the poetry of different modern nations.</p>

<p>If the character of the poetry may be taken as the criterion
by which to judge of the degree of civilization to which any
people had attained in the earlier period of their history,
Spain has a good right to claim the first place among the
nations of Europe, when emerging from that period denominated
the Dark Ages. While the popular poetry of other
nations at that period was almost entirely occupied with
childish stories of giants and supernatural beings, or in magnifying
the outrages of their heroes, and even of their outlaws,
as if they were honourable exploits, instead of merely
murder and rapine, the Spanish bards were engaged in celebrating
the patriotism and prowess of their Christian warriors
in strains not unworthy of the deeds they commemorated.
Those strains have been made sufficiently well-known
to the English reader by the labours of Southey and Lockhart,
for which the student of Spanish literature must feel
the utmost respect and gratitude, as well as by those of
Rodd, Bowring and others. From their translations the
character of those warriors will be found to have been
distinguished, differently from those of other nations in that
age, for the milder virtues combined with pure chivalrous
enterprise. If, as apparently was the case, the great champion,
known as the Cid, especially was deserving of the eminently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
honourable character depicted for him by the poets,
the popular feeling must have attained something of the
same tone when he was adopted as the first object of national
regard. Coming of a chivalrous race, engaged in a sacred
warfare, the Cid combined in his character all that was most
noble in human conduct, and gave to his countrymen a fame
which they knew full well how to appreciate. Thus the
spirit which the ballads breathed in recounting his exploits
was one in unison with that of the people. Each Spaniard
of after-times, in listening to those recitals, felt he had no
need to connect himself with fabulous narratives. He could
say, like Diomede,&mdash;“Of this race and blood do I boast myself
to be”&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Ταύτης τοι γενεῆς τε καὶ αἴματος εὕχομαι εἶναι,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and so feeling could identify himself truly with his heroes.</p>

<p>Formed originally of very different races, Celts and Goths,
mixed with the descendants of Romans and Phœnicians or
Carthaginians, the Spaniards had against the Moors become
amalgamated into one people, whose great bond of union was
their religion more even than their country. This holy cause
ennobled their conduct, and gave them higher aims and motives
than any ordinary warfare could do; so that acting constantly
under the sense of such feelings, their national character
assumed the staid bearing, which has always since so
favourably distinguished it. Hence also the national literature,
even in its lightest productions, assumed the tone of
high moral and practical tendency which it has generally
borne, far removed from the comparatively trifling topics
which formed the staple subjects of the literature of neighbouring
countries.</p>

<p>There is another mistake into which some writers have
fallen, in supposing that Spain owed her civilization entirely
to the Moors. The Arab conquest undoubtedly entailed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
her for many ages a succession of enlightened as well as warlike
rulers, who are justly to be classed among the greatest
patrons of literature and art; but they fostered rather than
founded the sciences that afterwards flourished under their
rule, and which they found preparing to burst forth in the
country they conquered. Though their forefathers might
have come from the seats of learning in the East, such as
they then were, the immediate conquerors of Spain were
natives of the neighbouring parts of Africa, where the sciences
had not flourished in any remarkable degree before the
conquest, and where they did not rise subsequently to any
eminence. The learned Lampillas, who has given us a very
able Vindication of Spanish Literature, in answer to the attacks
of some Italian critics, might justly have gone further
than he has done as to its merits under the Moorish domination.
Rather than as owing her advances in learning and
civilization to the Moors, it is more probable that these were
the remains of former civilization, existing among the Roman
colonies on the dissolution of the empire. At that time
Spain was essentially inhabited by descendants of Romans,
as it still continues to be, mainly, to the present day. Latin
had become the language of the country, and the best of
the later Latin authors, Seneca, Lucan, Martial, Quinctilian
and others, were natives of the Peninsula. The Romans had
planted sixty-seven colonies there, and in the time of Vespasian
could enumerate 360 cities inhabited by them. These
would undoubtedly retain their municipal institutions, and
were perhaps more retentive of Roman manners than were
even the towns of Italy. The original inhabitants had been
driven into the mountains of Catalonia, Cantabria and Lusitania.
They were of Celtic origin, and their descendants in
those provinces still show that origin by a different pronunciation
of the language imposed on the country by the Romans;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
while the Castillians, being of purer descent from them,
speak even now a language little different from that in common
colloquial use under the Emperors. The lower orders, in
fact, speak an idiom nearer to it than do the educated classes,
showing that the main race of the people, in Madrid for instance,
remains essentially Roman. In Betica or Andalusia
and the South of Spain, the descendants of Romans had become
incorporated with those of Phœnician or Carthaginian
and a few Greek colonists, forming together a race perhaps
still more civilized than the new-comers. Thus the Moors
found the people they had conquered in a high state of civilization,
scarcely affected by former conquests, and they had
only the merit of accepting and continuing the mental culture
which they found there, and which they had not possessed
in their native deserts.</p>

<p>The Goths and Vandals had swept like a hurricane over
Spain; but they passed over it without leaving any considerable
traces of their conquest. This is clear from the circumstance
of so few Northern words remaining in the language
of the country. At the entrance of the Moors into Spain,
the dominant party there was certainly of Gothic descent;
but they had already lost their Northern idioms, and were
immerged in the mass of the people they had conquered, in
the usual course of such events, as the Scandinavians soon
did in Normandy and the Normans in England. When the
races had begun to amalgamate in Spain, the distinctive lines
might have been longer discernible in the South, if it had not
been for the Moorish invasion. This soon repeated the events
of former conquests, in the extermination of the fighting men
and the enslaving of the other classes, who became feudatories
or worse. Those who escaped to the mountains of the North
constituted a nucleus of resistance, which was no doubt much
strengthened in their subsequent contests by the aid of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
Christian population left of necessity among the Moors, who
thus became dangerous as internal enemies, though they had
been tolerated at first as valuable dependents. The war that
then arose in Spain, and continued for upwards of 600 years,
was imbued, on the part of the Christians, with all those ingredients
of religious as well as patriotic feeling that render wars
remarkable for desperate conflict. On the part of the Moors,
it is but justice toward them to say, that for chivalrous honour
and bravery they proved themselves in no respect inferior to
their opponents, who, thus engaged in generous rivalry, became
distinguishable for the same virtues.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the wars between the Christians and
the Moors were too near to the every-day experience of the
people to allow of any imaginary addition to the legends of
the times, and they were too engrossing in importance and
interest to require any heightening. The ballads founded
upon them, therefore, assumed almost the matter-of-fact air
of history, and this seemed hence to become the characteristic
of all the subsequent literature of Spain. It is true that
romances abounded in which giants and other absurdities of
knight-errantry might be found, but they were principally of
foreign origin, and did not become incorporated in the national
poetry. This national poetry was always true to its
mission, for it may be observed that the poets of Spain have
seldom or never gone beyond their own history for their
heroes; they have rather instinctively followed the maxim of
the great lyrist of old, not to select objects of admiration from
strangers, but to seek them at home,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Οὐδ’ ἀλλοτρίων ἔρωτες</div>
<div class="verse">Ἀνδρὶ Φέρειν κρέσσονες,</div>
<div class="verse">Οἰκόθεν μάτευε.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thus also they were secure of the sympathy of their audience,
and found patriotism the best inspirer of poetry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>None of the Spanish poets, of either former or present
times, can be said to have attained the highest rank; yet as
they have always shown a predilection for subjects of real incident
and passion or feeling, they have gained, in perhaps a
greater degree than those of any other modern nation, that
hold upon the popular affections which arises from all earnest
participation in kindred sentiments. This might arise partly
from the national character developed, as before intimated, in
the Moorish wars, and partly from the personal tendencies of
the respective individuals. Whilst in other countries the
poets were generally to be found among the classes dependent
upon the rich and powerful, in Spain they were persons generally
of the highest classes. Some were of royal rank, others
were eminent as statesmen, and others, if not of the same
high station, were yet equally engaged in military service or the
active business of life. Three of the most favourite poets, Garcilasso
de la Vega, Manrique, and Cadahalso, died the death of
soldiers from wounds received in warfare. Ercilla, author of
the chief poem in the Spanish language, which may be considered
an Epic, was a participant in the wars he so graphically
describes. Cervantes received three wounds at the battle
of Lepanto, by one of which he lost an arm. Calderon de la
Barca passed many years of his life in the campaigns in the
Low Countries, where he gained great military reputation;
and Lope de Vega was one of the few adventurers in the “Invincible
Armada” who were fortunate enough to return to
their native country. Such men were not likely to indulge
in dreamy idealities, or idle reveries, and fantastic imaginations,
the offspring of morbid temperaments and sedentary
habits. On the contrary, they were only calculated to adopt
that peculiar manliness of style and sentiment, which their
successors, from example, from national character, and from
being placed in similar circumstances of life, have continued.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
How far those circumstances have affected the modern literature
of Spain may be best seen from the memoirs hereafter
detailed of the principal poets individually. Our present
purpose in this Introduction is only to make general observations
to lead to the conclusions that may be deduced from
them.</p>

<p>Spain, as it has been already observed, cannot boast of
having ever produced a poet of the highest class, meaning by
that term, one of such high creative genius as to stamp his
character, not only on the literature of his own age and
country, but also on that of all successive ages within his
possible influence. Of such poets the world has only seen
four or five at the utmost, with the exception of the inspired
writers, referring to Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, and
perhaps we may add, Byron. With these, Virgil and other
imitators must not be classed, however great the talents they
may have displayed, nor yet other writers of greater originality
and even genius, who have, however, confined themselves to
minor works or those on less important subjects. Of such
writers of great original genius, who did not aim at works of
the highest order, Spanish literature may claim as many as
that of any other country. With them the English reader
has been made acquainted more fully than with the writers
of most other modern countries, by the works of Bouterwek
and Sismondi, translated respectively by Mrs. Ross and William
Roscoe, and now by the more comprehensive work of
Mr. Ticknor (New York, 1849; London, 1850), who has supplied
the deficiencies the others had left in the course of their
inquiries. Of these works Sismondi’s is little more than a
repetition of Bouterwek’s, without the acknowledgement
made which was in justice due to his original. That however
was in reality so jejune in treating of the materials at the
command of the writer, as almost to warrant the use of his materials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
for a livelier production. Another work has been lately
published on Spanish literature by Mr. A. F. Foster (Edinburgh,
1851), compiled in like manner from former writers, which,
for succinct and able treatment of the subject, may perhaps
be recommended as the one best suited to the general reader.
But Mr. Ticknor’s book must remain the great work of reference
to the older Spanish authors, as he has left little for
future writers to supply respecting them. Yet neither has
he gone scarcely any further than Bouterwek, who wrote
at the beginning of this century, and since whose time so
many writers have arisen in Spain superior to any perhaps
that have preceded them. In such works we have more
cause to congratulate ourselves on having any one to undertake
the labour of going over so wide a field, than to complain
of his stopping short at a point where less was known
of Spanish literature, and where it became so much more interesting
as connected with our own times. But as all the
compilers now mentioned have so confined their labours to
works written previously to the present century, it may be
considered acceptable, in continuation of them, that the present
essay should be offered to the public. This is, however,
also undertaken on a more extended and somewhat different
plan; not merely giving short notices of the several authors
and their works, as in the nature of a catalogue or dictionary,
but taking only the principal poets for a particular account of
their history, and giving translations from their works most
characteristic of their genius or best suited for translation, for
the purpose of enabling the critical notices respecting them to
be better understood.</p>

<p>In treating of the literature of any country historically, it
may perhaps be considered necessary to give a catalogue of
every person who has published a book of any pretensions to
notice, whatever the different gradations of talent between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
the authors; but for the general reader, the better course
seems rather to be to pass by those works which the nation
had not accepted as to be incorporated in the national literature,
and to dwell extendedly on those which, by repeated
editions, were entitled to be considered of that character.
Bouterwek’s work on Spanish literature, which appears to
have been his own performance, and which certainly does
great credit to his industry, is an exemplification of the
former course. The volume on Portuguese literature, under
his name, which he acknowledges to have been the contribution
of a friend, is not so liable to the same objection, and
may be considered written according to the other. It is so
difficult a task, and so enviable a lot for any one to attain to
excellence above his fellows, that beyond its being due to his
own merits, it is an advantage to others to show them by his
example the way to attain to the same eminence. Johnson,
in his Lives of the English Poets, has given us a work admirable
for its criticisms as well as for the other lessons it
conveys for general conduct in life; but those criticisms
would have lost much of their effect, if they had not had appended
to them the works to which they referred. Biography,
to be worthy of study, should be something more than
a mere enumeration of those particulars of a man’s life which
are of the common class of every-day events, so as to be the
reflex of every one’s in his station. If any man’s life be at
all more memorable than that of ordinary mortals, the means
by which he obtained his reputation alone merit a lengthened
consideration for an example for others. With authors those
claims must rest on their writings, which will speak for themselves;
but this cannot be the case with foreign authors, as
few readers of other nations can ever be expected to have acquired
their language so perfectly as to understand the essential
beauty of their poetry. To enable such readers therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
to understand their works, or even the criticisms upon them,
a translation is necessary, on which again much depends, not
only in respect of faithfulness but also of felicity of transcript,
to render the beauties of the original sufficiently perceptible.</p>

<p>Many rules have been given by critics for the benefit of
translators from the earliest times till now, to which it is not
necessary here to refer further than to state the plan upon which
these translations have been made. In a didactic or historical
work, the more precisely the translation is made according to
the letter of the original, the greater merit may it be considered
to possess. But in works of imagination, especially
of poetry, it may be more important to attend to the spirit
of the original than to the literal construction. The main
thoughts contained in each passage should be as faithfully
given in the one case as in the other, though it may not be
necessary, and sometimes not even becoming, to have the
same regard to details. With poetry, the translator should
make it his great aim to consider how his author would have
expressed the same thoughts if he had been writing in English
verse, and thus mould the original ideas into synonymous
poetical expressions, as far as the idioms of the two languages
and the requirements of metre will allow. It would be a poor
vanity in a translator to think of improving on his original,
so far as to make any alteration or addition merely for that
purpose. But where any words admit of synonyms with different
shades of meaning, it is certainly his right, if not his
duty, to adopt the one he thinks most suitable. Sometimes
it may seem to him accordant with good taste to make a more
decided alteration, and in every language there are many expressions
sufficiently poetical and appropriate, which if construed
literally into another would appear otherwise. These
the author, it may be supposed, would have altered himself,
under the same circumstances, and the other, therefore, in so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
doing, would be only acting on his presumed wishes. In all
cases much must be left of necessity to the translator’s judgement,
and he, with every care he can take, must still be content
to share, with Pope and Dryden and the greatest masters
of rhyme, the consciousness of scarcely ever being able fully
to convey the conceptions of a foreign author. The shackles
of rhyme also require something to be sacrificed to them, so
as of themselves alone to prevent any exact copy being given
in verse. Yet still acting on the above considerations, and
by rejecting expletives in some cases and adding a few in
others, in following up the train of ideas suggested by the
original, we may hope to succeed perhaps not only in giving
the meaning, but something also of the spirit even of foreign
authors.</p>

<p>It is fortunate for any writer to have his works sent forth
to the world in any language of more than usual ascendency,
such as the Latin or English, whereby to obtain for himself,
if he can claim it, the most extended reputation. But it is
more fortunate for a translator under similar circumstances,
because languages of such a character are almost of necessity
mixed languages, acquiring from that cause an extraordinary
nerve and richness, which render translations into them to be
made more easily and satisfactorily than from them into a
poorer. The English is essentially suited for such a purpose,
as, being compounded of the French and German languages,
it becomes a double one, combining the nerve of the one
with the facility of expression of the other, and the copiousness
arising from the union of both. The Latin is still more
a mixed language, the roots of which are yet to be developed,
notwithstanding all the labours of philologists, who have
erred in wandering after imaginary extinct languages for its
derivations, instead of looking into those yet existing. Considering
the Spanish to be the direct descendant of the Latin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
it may be a matter of surprise that, though a very sonorous
language, it cannot be termed a rich one. Abounding in
long words (sesquipedalia verba), it loses in precision and
strength what is gained in sound, and thus the ideas are encumbered
when simplification was required. The comparatively
monosyllabic character of the English language has in
this respect an immense advantage for the translator, as it
enables him to give the sentiments of the original more concisely
than one from it into another. Having also more
synonyms with different shades of meaning, a greater precision
may be lost or gained, according to the circumstances
and the judgement applied to them. Thus a translation may
sometimes be even superior to the original, from its giving the
ideas more distinctly, and as it is the test of good writing to
find how it reads in another language, so with really superior
authors it may be a matter of little importance in what version
their thoughts are expressed. “Words are the daughters
of earth, but thoughts are the sons of heaven.” It is not
presumed hereby that the following translations all come
under this consideration, but with the advantages above expressed,
it may be hoped that, as exotics in a greenhouse,
these flowers of Spanish poetry may be found pleasing representations
of what they were in their native soil, even if they
cannot be made entirely denizens of our own.</p>

<p>Differing entirely from those writers who suppose that the
best days of Spanish literature have gone by, and believing,
on the contrary, that it never has been more truly original
and flourishing than during the present and preceding ages,
it might be justly considered presumptuous in any new author
to present such opinions to the world without showing the
grounds on which they were founded. Bouterwek and his
copyist, Sismondi, together with their criticisms on the several
Spanish poets, contented themselves with giving merely a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
lines from the more favoured ones in their original language,
without any translation whereby to enable those ignorant of
it to judge even of the thoughts they contained. They thus
resemble the wiseacre in Hierocles (the Σχολαστικὸς, which
word Johnson has strangely translated ‘pedant,’ taking the
primary for the intended meaning), who brought a stone as
a description of a building. In so doing, they have seldom
given even favourable specimens; but if they had, there are
few authors who can be rightly estimated by isolated passages,
or even by any one short poem. Almost all authors
are unequal in their productions, and many seem, by an accidental
felicity, to have produced some one effusion to which
none of their other efforts could ever approach. As instances
of this, we may note Heber’s ‘Palestine;’ Pringle’s lines,
‘Afar in the Desert,’ and Leyden’s ‘Ode to an Indian Gold
Coin,’ which Colton has pronounced, in his opinion, “to
come as near to perfection as the sublunary Muse can
arrive at.”</p>

<p>It is only by several well-sustained efforts that any author
has a right to be placed among poets, and it would not be
just, therefore, to judge of any without such a consideration
of their productions. In all the translations here given, the
most characteristic specimens of the style of each writer have
been sought, particularly those containing what seemed to be
his favourite course of thought, while selecting entire, though
generally short, poems for that purpose. With the exception
of the Duke de Rivas, the poets enumerated in this work have
not published poems of any great length, and therefore the
plan adopted may be considered altogether appropriate to the
object in view.</p>

<p>With regard to the metres chosen, no rule has been attempted
of taking the original strictly for a guide, where the
style of verse, in a different language, would not admit of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
easily. Perhaps the truest definition of Poetry may be given
in the words of our great poet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent2">“Thoughts that voluntary move</div>
<div class="verse">Harmonious numbers&mdash;”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">for it may be observed, that the finest passages are generally
the easiest for translation and for rhyme. Thus keeping the
original constantly in view as the guide, the verse has been
adopted as the thoughts seemed to indicate the metre most
appropriate.</p>

<p>With the disadvantage of rhyme, in a foreign language, no
apology is requisite for the ruggedness of any lines which the
critic may point out. I differ totally from those writers,
Coleridge and others, who affect a contempt for finished versification,
and rely entirely on the brilliancy of their ideas.
Whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well, according
to the writer’s best capability, and the reader’s ear ought
surely to be as much consulted as his mind is sought to be
engaged. Those who have had to write “nonsense verses”
at school or college, have no right to excuse themselves from
labouring to make their lines run smoothly. If, therefore,
any of the following translations are not so rendered, it will
occasion the writer much regret that his best efforts for that
purpose have been unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Another complaint may be anticipated, that this work does
not comprehend authors either in prose or the drama. The
fault, if it be one, must be admitted, with the observation,
that the task undertaken was felt sufficient of itself to require
the best exertions of the writer. According to the plan laid
down of giving only entire pieces, in the case of including
either prose or dramatic writers, the work would have been
increased to an inordinate extent, or the plan must have been
adopted of giving extracts, which would be contrary to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
opinion expressed of the best course to be pursued. If this
attempt should meet with public approbation, some one else
may be induced to continue the further service. If it should
not, the labour expended on a larger work would be so much
more given in vain. In the one case, the failure might be
ascribed to having attempted too much; in the other, the
approbation might not have been gained but for the efforts
having been directed undividedly to what was thus only within
the reach of accomplishment.</p>

<p>In sequence of the remark before made, of the manly style
of thought, feeling and expression which had characterized
the older Spanish writers, from their having been persons
generally who had engaged in the active affairs of life, the
reader may perhaps feel interested in tracing how the same
causes have produced the same effects with their successors.
From the memoirs hereafter detailed, it may be seen that no
fewer than six out of the twelve had to suffer the evils of exile
for public or private opinions, of whom three so died unhappily
in foreign countries. Three others, though not actually
exiled, were subjected to long and cruel imprisonment for the
same causes, while two out of the remaining three had to take
their share of burdens in the public service during the troubled
state of the country. Such men could have no mawkish
sentiments to develope, and no fantastic feelings to indulge.
What they felt, they felt deeply; what they observed, they
observed distinctly, and thus were enabled to give their
thoughts and feelings clearly and strongly.</p>

<p>But in addition to the causes assigned for the superior
character of modern Spanish poetry in particular, there is
one other to be suggested, the association of which may perhaps
occasion some surprise, though it may not be for that
the less indubitable. This is the fact of the later Spanish
writers having, perhaps unconsciously, but unmistakenly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
taken better models than their predecessors by preferring the
study of English literature to that of the French. This fact,
though without the full inference that might have been drawn
from it, has been observed by a German author, F. J. Wolf,
of the Imperial Library at Vienna, who has published a collection
of modern Spanish poetry, with biographical notices,
Paris, 1837, in two volumes&mdash;‘Floresta de Rimas Modernas
Castellanas.’ It is an interesting collection, but being all
given in the Spanish language, is only available to those who
are acquainted with it. In the introduction to this work, Wolf
treats of the “efforts of Melendez and the Salamanca school
to give a new splendour to Spanish poetry, partly by the
study and imitation of the ancient and good Spanish writers,
taking advantage of the national forms, and partly by making
it more profound and substantial, imitating not only and exclusively
the French, but also and especially the English.”
(Page 15.)</p>

<p>During the early part of the last century, consequent upon
the accession of the Bourbons to the throne, the writers of
verse in Spain, who obtained most favour among their contemporaries,
formed their style avowedly upon the model of
what was called the French school, and thus taking examples
unworthy of imitation, became still more wretched as copyists.
Towards the end of the century, however, a feeling arose, on
the other side, in favour of the study of English literature,
which has led to the happiest results. Of the twelve poets
whose lives and poems it is the purpose of this work to delineate,
no fewer than ten may be observed acquainted in no
inconsiderable degree with the best English authors and proficient
in the English language. Two only, Breton de los Herreros
and Zorrilla, seem not to have extended their studies so
far. With the peculiar humorous vein of the former, perhaps
the deficiency may not be considered as leaving any merit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
to be supplied. But it does seem a matter of regret that a
person of Zorrilla’s exalted genius should have confined his
studies so much to French writers, and so have deprived himself
of the expansion necessary for the highest flights of poetry.
France has never produced a great painter or a great poet.
The very language, so monotonous and unmusical, in having
the accent almost invariably on the last syllable of the words,
seems opposed to rhythmical cadence, and not to admit of the
highest excellence either in oratory or poetry. Whatever may
be the cause, it is evident that such excellence has not been
attained in the language, and therefore the best works in it
cannot be models for imitation when they are only themselves
of an inferior value.</p>

<p>Beyond the writers enumerated hereafter, whose memoirs
and writings are to be considered worthy of fuller notice,
there are several others who, as especially coming under the
consideration above suggested, may here be noticed in further
corroboration of the statements we have made.</p>

<p>1. Juan de Escoiquiz, tutor to Ferdinand VII., one of the
most upright, if not most successful, public men of his time,
published, in 1798, an epic poem ‘On the Conquest of Mexico,’
which showed considerable poetical ability, though it did not
obtain much popular favour. In 1797 he published a translation
of Young’s ‘Night Thoughts,’ from the English into
Spanish verse, and in 1814 a translation of Milton’s ‘Paradise
Lost.’ Of the former, a translation in prose had been previously
published by Cristoval Caldera. Escoiquiz died in
1814.</p>

<p>2. Josè de Cadalso or Cadahalso, born 1741, was a person
of rank and fortune, who had travelled much in his youth,
and become proficient in various foreign languages and literatures,
especially the English. He wrote several works,
both in prose and verse, which were received with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
favour at the time, and have been republished frequently
since his death. The last edition was in 1818, in three volumes,
under the editorship of the late learned Navarrete,
who appended to them an interesting biography of the author.
Among the miscellanies are several translations from
the English, which language, we are informed, Cadalso not
only studied himself assiduously, but induced Melendez
Valdes to adopt for peculiar study also. This eminent poet
was in early life so assisted by Cadalso as to have been pronounced
his “best work,” and he, as may be seen hereafter,
seems sedulously to have followed the good counsels and example
given him by his friend. Cadalso, like so many other
of the principal poets of Spain, had embraced a military
career, in which, having been ordered with his regiment to
the siege of Gibraltar, he there received a wound of which he
died a few days after, the 27th February, 1782. His death
was a great loss to Spanish literature, and it was equally
lamented by the English in the besieged fortress, by whom
he was much esteemed from previous friendly communications.</p>

<p>3. The Conde de Noronia, born 1760, died 1816, another
poetical writer of considerable reputation, was also engaged
in military service, in which he attained high rank, and with
the division of the Spanish army under his command, gained
the victory at the battle of San Payo over the French. He
was appointed ambassador successively at Berne and St. Petersburgh,
and was celebrated as a diplomatist for his knowledge
of English and other languages. Notwithstanding an
active life in the public service, he found leisure for literary
pursuits, and in 1800 published a collection of poems in two
volumes. Among these are to be observed several translations
from the English, of which one of Dryden’s celebrated
‘Ode for St. Cecilia’s Day,’ rendered into Spanish verse with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
much spirit, deserves particular mention. The best of his
poems seems an ‘Ode on the Death of Cadalso,’ by whose side
he was present when he received his wound. The Conde
further attempted an epic, in twelve cantos, entitled ‘Ommiada,’
detailing the events in the reign of Abderaman, the
last of the Ommiades, which poem was published in two volumes
in 1816. For the purpose of assisting him in this
work, he had translated several pieces from the Arabic and
other eastern languages into Spanish verse, published since
at Paris in 1833.</p>

<p>4. Juan Maria Maury, who died in 1846, was another
writer of considerable talent. He was sent early in life to
France, and completed his education in England, becoming
thereby well acquainted with the language and literature of
both countries. His principal work is a poem entitled, ‘Esvero
y Almedora,’ in twelve cantos, published at Paris in 1840.
It is founded on the adventures of a passage-at-arms, held
against all comers, in 1434, at the bridge of Orbiza, near
Leon, and contains several interesting scenes spiritedly described.
His earliest work was a poem he called ‘British
Aggression,’ published in 1806, the sentiments of which he
seems afterwards to have considerably modified. Maury appears
to have been a person of very amiable character, and
much esteemed by all who knew him, judging by the manner
in which Del Rio and others write respecting him. In his
latter years he resided almost entirely at Paris, and gained
for himself the extraordinary merit of being esteemed also a
correct writer of French verse, by his translations of the principal
Spanish poets into that language. This work, published
in two volumes at Paris in 1826, entitled, ‘Espagne Poétique,
Choix de Poésies Castellanes depuis Charles Quint jusqu’à
nos jours,’ is, as the name imports, a selection of Spanish
poetry with critical and biographical notices, made with much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
taste and judgement, and forming altogether a very interesting
work for the French student of Spanish literature. It is
dedicated to his friends Arriaza and Quintana, in a poetical
epistle, from which the following extract may be considered
acceptable in corroboration of the previous remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Sans doute, Emmanuel, aux champs de Tamise</div>
<div class="verse">Triomphe une vertu qu’ailleurs tu crus permise,</div>
<div class="verse">Et qui là fier génie a ravi le trident.</div>
<div class="verse">Jeune j’y respirai l’orgueil indépendant;</div>
<div class="verse">Là, j’admirai l’accord, merveille alors unique,</div>
<div class="verse">Qui règle et garantit, sur le sol britannique</div>
<div class="verse">Au trône ses splendeurs, aux grands l’autorité,</div>
<div class="verse">Aux citoyens leurs droits, qu’on nomma liberté,</div>
<div class="verse">Et le temps destructeur y consacre, y conserve</div>
<div class="verse">Le plus beau monument élevé par Minerve.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>5. Josè Joaquin Mora, born at Cadiz, 1783, and yet happily
surviving, is another modern poet of great merit. When
the French invaded Spain, he entered a regiment of dragoons
in the national cause, and was made prisoner in 1809, in consequence
of which he was detained in France six years. He
took advantage of this residence in that country to pursue his
studies, and on the return of peace he undertook the editorship
of the ‘Scientific and Literary Chronicle of Madrid,’
which, in 1820, he converted into ‘The Constitutional.’ In
1823 he had to emigrate to London, where he wrote and
published several periodical and other works, under the
auspices of Messrs. Ackerman, besides various translations.
He afterwards went to Buenos Ayres, Chili and Bolivia, from
which last republic he returned to London as Consul-General,
and published, in 1840, his principal work, entitled ‘Spanish
Legends.’ This work, which is highly praised by Ochoa, gives,
as the title imports, descriptive accounts of various events in
the history of Spain, according to what seems to be the
favourite formula of modern Spanish poetry. Another work
he published, in 1826, entitled ‘Poetical Meditations,’ is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
founded principally on Blair’s celebrated poem, ‘The Grave.’
Wolf pronounces him excelling in his satirical essays, which,
he says, are full of grace and ease.</p>

<p>In addition to the writers mentioned above, and those
whose works form the main purpose of this work hereafter in
detail, many others have appeared, both during the latter
part of the last century and during the present, who have
shown much talent, and have been deservedly received with
much favour by their countrymen. It will be sufficient for
us here to give the names of Cienfuegos, Tapia, Lista, Gallego,
S. Bermudez de Castro, Garcia Gutierrez and Pastor
Diaz among them; and to meet any observation that may be
suggested on account of no fuller notice being taken of them,
it may be allowed me to state, that I have notwithstanding
read and examined carefully all their works, and those of
many others whose names it is needless to recapitulate. I
would further add, that in so doing, although there was certainly
much in them to admire, yet there was nothing in
them, in my judgement, suited for translation to interest
English readers, whose tastes it was my duty principally to
consult. Some of those just mentioned and others omitted, I
have personally known and appreciated in private life, but in
all the selections and criticisms made or repeated, I have
allowed no consideration to weigh with me, except the respect
due to superior merit alone. So much of this superior merit
seemed to me to exist in modern Spanish literature, that I
ventured to think the English public would receive favourably
this attempt to make them acquainted with it. If it
should fail, the blame must attach to the translator; if it be
received favourably, there is yet a rich mine of intellectual
wealth in store to reward the labours of those who choose to
undertake it.</p>

<p>The student who wishes to follow in the same course, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
find the way much prepared for him in the various collections
of ancient and modern poetry lately published. Those by
Maury and Wolf have been already mentioned. Quintana
has, in the late edition of his great work, brought down the
series of national poets to the beginning of this century; and
Ochoa has, lastly, given a very valuable addition to his other
labours of criticisms and compilation, in his Notices for a
Library of contemporary Spanish writers;&mdash;‘Apuntes para
una Biblioteca de Escritores Españoles contemporaneos,’ in
two volumes, Paris, 1847. Ferrer del Rio has also conferred
a great service on the national literature, by giving a
series of biographical sketches, ably written, of the principal
Spanish writers of the present day, ‘Galeria de la Literatura
Española,’ published by Mellado, at Madrid, 1846. From
these works, when no other authority is mentioned as of
distinct character, the notices in this work have been compiled,
except in a few instances, which will be found also
generally stated when they have been obtained from private
information. The facts, of necessity, could not but be learned
from such sources, and the translator is only answerable for
the selection of those he thought worthy of being repeated,
and the arrangement, in addition to the criticisms that coincided
with his own judgement, for his adoption.</p>

<p>In conclusion of these introductory remarks, it now only
remains necessary further to observe, that the rules of Spanish
versification are very similar to the English, being dependent
upon accents, according to the rhythm adopted on certain
syllables of each line, whether alternately or further removed.
The rule as to rhyme is also the same, admitting of single
or double rhymes, used in one case or the other, according as
the accent is on the last syllable of the final word or the penultimate.
The latter, however, is more common in Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
than in English, where it seems only suited for the livelier
strains of verse.</p>

<p>But in addition to the usual method of using rhymes, dependent
in English and most other languages upon the consonants
rather than the vowels, the Spaniards have a form of
verse of which the rhyme is dependent on the vowel only,
and the consonants may be entirely dissimilar. This form of
verse they call Asonantes, in contradistinction to the other,
which they call Consonantes, or full and perfect rhyme. Thus
in the first stanza of the ‘Alcazar of Seville,’ the words <i lang="es">prolijas</i>
and <i lang="es">cornisas</i> are Consonantes or full rhymes, but in the
following verses <i lang="es">miran</i> and <i lang="es">distintas</i> are Asonantes, as also
<i lang="es">risa</i> and <i lang="es">evitan</i>. The Spaniards conceive the Asonantes to
be a form peculiar to themselves, but it is one common to
many other nations, in the earlier stages of poetical composition.
In the earliest Spanish poems, asonants and consonants
were used together promiscuously, as may be observed
particularly in the early poems in the Galician dialect; and
it is curious to trace in this respect, as well as in many
of their words, vestiges of their Celtic descent, this same
form being also one of the prominent features of Celtic versification.
In their modern asonante verse, the Spanish poets
usually exclude consonantes, and that form continues in
much favour, probably on account of the words in their language,
as in the Latin, having generally so much the same
sound as to make a variation pleasing to the ear, to break the
monotonous effect of a too frequent recurrence of similar terminations.
For this reason, no doubt, it was that the Latin
poets did not adopt the system of rhymes, and for the same
also it is common now in Spanish poems to have lines occasionally
to which no other line presents a rhyme, giving
thereby a pleasing effect to the whole. In our language, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
the contrary, where, from the ruggedness of its character, the
terminations vary so exceedingly as to make them often even
difficult to be found for the purposes of rhyme, the recurrence
of rhyme gives a more pleasing sound to the ear from the
degree of surprise that is thus occasioned. In Spanish they
might easily be made of one vowel termination for a long
poem, so that the difficulty in it is to avoid the too frequent
recurrence of the same sound.</p>

<p>Martinez de la Rosa has boasted of the variety of rhymes
in Spanish; but he refers to double as well as single rhymes,
and in this and in other respects is carried away by his
ardour, in admiration of his country’s language, much further
than the facts will be found to support him. Thus he also
praises the number and variety of metres used in it as extraordinary,
when in fact they are no more, so than any other
neighbouring language could present. It may be justly conceded,
that poetry has been cultivated lately in Spain with
much assiduity and success; but there is no peculiarity in the
language to give it an advantage over others in respect to
metres. The strict censorship which has weighed down the
energies of the country, with regard to most subjects of public
discussion, has had the effect of directing talent to the cultivation
of poetry, as almost the only road to literary reputation.
This it is, combined with the sensitive character of the nation,
that has made their poets attain the eminence we are
bound in justice to award them; and it is fortunate for them
that they have in their language so admirable an exponent of
their genius, as it must in fairness be allowed, though the
merit still remains peculiarly their own.</p>

<p>The following is a summary list of the principal Modern
Spanish Poets whose memoirs and writings it is the object
of this work more particularly to make known to the English
public, given with a statement of dates respecting their lives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
for the purpose of enabling the reader to compare more
easily the periods in which they flourished. They are, it will
be observed, twelve in number, and the list has been divided
into two parts, as marking an evidently distinctive character
of the poetry in the former and latter part of the epoch which
they have rendered memorable.</p>

<h2>PRELIMINARY NOTE.</h2>

<p>For readers unacquainted with the Spanish language, it may be
perhaps most advisable, in this place, to affix a few short instructions
for the proper pronunciation of such names and words as are
to be found in the following pages.</p>

<p>1. The vowels in Spanish have each invariably their peculiar
sound; not as in English, where each has two or more sounds,
making them in fact so distinct as strictly requiring to be designated
by different characters, or after the manner of the Hebrew
points. Thus <i>a</i> has always the broad open sound found in the
English words <i>arm</i>, <i>arrack</i>.</p>

<p><i>e</i>, long or short, as in the English words <i>ere</i>, <i>ever</i>.</p>

<p><i>i</i> and <i>y</i>, as in <i>machine</i>, <i>syntax</i>.</p>

<p><i>o</i>, long or short, as in <i>ore</i>, <i>host</i>, <i>hostage</i>.</p>

<p><i>u</i> has uniformly the sound of <i>oo</i> in <i>food</i>. The Celtic sound of
this vowel, preserved in France and Portugal, is unknown in Spain,
and also in the Basque or Biscayan language.</p>

<p>2. Of the consonants, <i>b</i> has a softer sound than in English, and
approaches to <i>v</i>, which again is made to sound like <i>b</i>. Thus the
city of the Havana is, in Spanish spelling, La Habana, and the
river Bidasoa is written Vidasoa.</p>

<p><i>c</i>, before <i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>u</i>, is to be pronounced hard, as in English; before
<i>e</i> or <i>i</i>, it is to be sounded like <i>th</i> in <i>thin</i>, though in the provinces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
this pronunciation is giving way to the French and English mode
of sounding the letter. Thus the name of the great Roman orator
is pronounced Thithero. <i>ch</i> has always the soft sound it usually
has in English, as in <i>chat</i>, <i>check</i>, <i>chin</i>, <i>choke</i>, <i>chum</i>.</p>

<p><i>d</i>, at the end of a word, is generally pronounced like <i>th</i>: thus
Madrid is Madrith; <i lang="es">ciudad</i>, a city, is pronounced <i>thiudath</i>; otherwise,
both <i>d</i> and <i>t</i> are spoken as in English, or slightly more dentally.</p>

<p><i>f</i> has the same sound as in English.</p>

<p><i>g</i> is an aspirate, like our <i>h</i>, more or less guttural, according to
the word. The soft sound of this letter, as in <i>gem</i>, left by the
Celts in Italy and Portugal, is unknown in Spain, as is also the
soft sound of the letter <i>j</i>.</p>

<p><i>h</i> may be said to be invariably a silent letter, and seems only
used to prevent two vowels running into each other, so as to form
a diphthong.</p>

<p><i>j</i> is a very harsh guttural, like the Hebrew <i>Cheth</i>. Thus Juan
(John) is to be pronounced strongly, Hwan; Josè (Joseph) also
strongly, Hosè.</p>

<p>The letters <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>p</i>, are the same as in English.</p>

<p><i>q</i> or <i>qu</i> has the sound of our <i>k</i>: thus <i lang="es">que</i> (that) is the same as
the Italian <i lang="it">che</i>.</p>

<p><i>r</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>t</i> have the same sounds as in English, except that the first
has one somewhat rougher, especially when two come together.</p>

<p><i>x</i> is a strong guttural, for which <i>j</i> is now generally used, as
Don Quijote.</p>

<p><i>z</i> is pronounced as <i>th</i>: thus Cadiz is sounded Cadith.</p>

<p>The Spaniards consider their <i>ll</i> and <i>ñ</i>, or <i>n</i> with a circumflex,
distinct letters, but they are in fact only the letters <i>l</i> or <i>n</i> with
the sound of <i>i</i> after them, as in the English words <i>million</i>, <i>minion</i>,
being the same sound that the French and Italians express by
<i>gn</i>, or <i>gl</i>. Several names may be found in the body of this work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>
altered according to our mode of spelling, though in the headings
retained as in the original, as Padillia instead of Padilla. For the
sake of preserving the sound free from constant explanation or
confusion, the like course has been sometimes adopted with regard
to other words, as, for instance, the name of the river Genil or
Xenil, represented in English as Henil.</p>

<p>Two or more vowels coming together are enunciated so as to
form one syllable generally in Spanish, and especially in poetry,
yet nevertheless so as to allow of each vowel to be sounded distinctly,
as each syllable is also.</p>

<p>With regard to accents, the general rule is, that it should be
placed on the penultimate syllable. There are many exceptions,
but in print these are always marked by the accent (´) on the
vowel indicated, except in words of two syllables, which, if ending
in a consonant, have generally the accent on the last syllable, if
ending in a vowel, on the first, without being notified.</p>

<p>From these notices it may be observed, that the Spanish language
is remarkable for two sounds, the guttural and the predominating
<i>th</i>, which distinguish it from the two sister dialects of
Italy and Portugal, while it is deficient in the soft sound of <i>g</i> and
<i>j</i>, found so frequently used in the latter. These two assimilate
so much to each other that natives of either country understand
those of the other readily, while they cannot those of Spain, showing
that the influence of the Gothic and Moorish invaders was impressed
there on the pronunciation of the common language, though
it was not extended to altering materially the language itself.</p>

<p>Besides the soft sound of the <i>g</i>, there are two other sounds unknown
in Spanish, though common in Portugal and France, left
by their former Celtic inhabitants, those of the <i>sh</i> or French <i>j</i>,
and the disagreeable nasal pronunciation of the letter <i>n</i>. The latter
is very slightly given in <i lang="es">Don</i>, and a few other words, but the
other is unknown. In Portuguese it is so prevalent that they
even use it for Latin words which it would be difficult to recognize
at first as the originals from which the others were derived; thus
the words <i lang="la">pluvia</i>, <i lang="la">plorare</i>, transformed in Spanish into <i lang="es">lluvia</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
<i lang="es">lorar</i>, are in Portuguese further transformed into <i lang="pt">chuva</i> (<i lang="pt">shuva</i>),
<i lang="pt">chorar</i> (<i lang="pt">shorar</i>). The natives of Galicia speak a dialect more
allied to Portuguese than the Spanish, being of more decided
Celtic descent, like the Portuguese, than the rest of the people of
the Peninsula. The natives of Catalonia speak a dialect half
French, half Spanish, which may be considered the representative
of the ancient Provencal or Limoisin. It is very guttural as well
as nasal. The Basque or Biscayan language is entirely distinct
from the modern Spanish, and also from the Latin, the Celtic, or
that of any neighbouring country, and is well deserving of study.
It has no harsh or disagreeable sounds in it, and abounds in
vowels, many words having not a single consonant in them.</p>

<p><a href="#note2" title="See note">An able and distinguished writer</a> in the Madrid Review
has observed, that if the question were asked as to which is
the first great name in modern Spanish literature, the answer
must unquestionably be&mdash;Jovellanos. It seems, therefore, only
a just deference to his merits, though it is but a fortuitous
coincidence in the order of dates, that we have to place his
name first in the series of modern Spanish poets. It is,
however, to his State Papers and his writings on Political
Economy that he principally owes his reputation; though it
is a proud consideration for Spanish literature, that, as regards
him, as well as Martinez de la Rosa and the Duke de
Rivas, she has to place the names of eminent statesmen
among her principal poets.</p>

<p>Jovellanos was born the 5th of January, 1744, at Gijon, a
town in the Asturias, of which his father was Regidor or
one of the chief Magistrates. His family connections were
of the class called Nobles, answering to the Noblesse of
France, and were moreover very influential and sufficiently
wealthy. To take advantage of the preferments these offe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>red
him, he was destined in early youth, being a younger son, for
the church, in which he entered into the first orders for the
purpose of holding several benefices that were given him.
He studied consecutively at Oviedo, Avila and Osma, where
he distinguished himself so much to the satisfaction of those
interested in his fortunes, that he was removed, in 1764, to
the University of Alcalà de Henares, and shortly afterwards
to Madrid to study law. His friends and relatives, having
become aware of his great talents, had now induced him to
abandon the clerical profession and engage in secular pursuits.
A person of his rank in those days was not at liberty
to practise as an advocate, though the young Noble, under
court favour, might administer the law; and thus he was, in
1767, when only in his twenty-fourth year, appointed judge
of criminal cases at Seville. In this office he conducted himself
with great ability and humanity, appearing to have been
the first to abandon the employment of torture for obtaining
confessions, which system has scarcely yet been discarded on
the Continent. As characteristic of him, it may here be
added, that he is reported to have been the first of the higher
magistrates in Spain who gave up the use of the official wig;
so that his unusual dress, combined with his youth, made
him on the bench more observed than perhaps even his talents
would at first have rendered him.</p>

<p>Whatever objections might have been made, if cause could
be found, he seems, after having served nearly ten years as
judge in the criminal courts, to have been advanced, with the
approbation of all parties, to the office of judge in civil cases,
also at Seville. This was an office much more agreeable to
his inclinations, though the salary was no higher than what
he had previously enjoyed. He had, however, other duties
also entrusted to him of minor character, though of proportionate
emolument, and thereupon he resigned his benefices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
in the church, which he had held till then, and to the duties
of which he had strictly attended. Beyond this act of disinterestedness,
he seems to have given his brother magistrates
no inconsiderable inquietude at the same time by refusing
some emoluments of office to which they considered themselves
entitled. But their minds were soon relieved from the
apprehensions his conduct might occasion them, as at the end
of four years he was, in 1778, appointed judge of criminal
cases at Madrid; an office generally considered of eminent
promotion, but which he accepted with regret.</p>

<p>In after times, every letter and every notice of Jovellanos
that could be found was eagerly sought and treasured up;
and from these and his own memorandums, it appears
he had good reason to consider the years he passed at
Seville as the happiest of his life. Honoured in his public
capacity and beloved in his social circle, he passed whatever
time he could spare from his official or private duties in literary
pursuits. It was then he wrote or prepared most of the
lighter works which entitle him to be ranked among the poets
of the age; the tragedy of “Pelayo,” and comedy of “The
Honourable Delinquent,” both which were highly esteemed
by his countrymen, as well as most of his minor poems. He
did not however confine himself to such recreations, but at
the same time entered on graver studies for the public service,
on which his fame was eventually established.</p>

<p>Shortly after Jovellanos joined the courts at Seville, he had
for one of his colleagues Don Luis Ignacio Aguirre, a person
of high literary attainments, who had travelled much, and
brought with him, as stated by Bermudez, many works in
English on Political Economy. To understand these, Jovellanos
immediately, under Aguirre’s guidance, proceeded to
learn the English language, of which he soon obtained a
competent knowledge. He then studied the science, t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>hen
newly dawning, from the works his friend afforded him, and
made himself a master of it, so as to give him a name among
the most eminent of its professors. Not contented with
these pursuits, his active mind was still further engaged in
whatever could tend to the benefit of society in the place of
his labours. He seems indeed to have always had before
him the consideration of what might be the fullest duties
his station imposed on him, beyond the mere routine of
official services. Not confining himself to these, much less
giving himself up to passive enjoyments, however harmless
or honourable in themselves, he seemed then and through
life as ever acting under the sense of a great responsibility,
as of the requirements of Him “who gave his servants
authority, and to every man his work.” Thus he instituted
a school at Seville for children, reformed the course of practice
at the hospitals, attended to the keeping of the public
walks and grounds in good order, and was foremost in every
case where charity called or good services were required.
Artists and men of genius found in him a friend, who, by
advice and other aid, was always ready to their call; and it
was observed that his only passion was for the purchase of
books and pictures, of which respectively he formed good
collections.</p>

<p>On giving up his duties at Seville, Jovellanos travelled
through Andalusia, and, as was his custom in all the places
he visited, made notes of whatever useful information he
could obtain respecting them, many of which were afterwards
published in a topographical work he assisted in bringing
forward. On arriving at Madrid, where his fame had preceded
him, he was at once chosen member of the different
learned societies, to several of which he rendered valuable
services. At Seville he had already prepared a sketch of his
great work, entitled “Agrarian Law,” in which he treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of the law and tenure of land, its cultivation, and other topics
connected with it. This work he then published in an extended
form, in which it has been reprinted several times,
separately as well as in his collected works. In the several
societies he also read many papers, one of which, “On Public
Diversions,” deserves to be named particularly, as containing
much curious information, as well as many excellent suggestions
for public advantage, on points which statesmen would
do well to remember more frequently than they are in the
habit of doing.</p>

<p>On leaving Seville, Jovellanos regretted that he had to
engage again in criminal cases, for which he had a natural
aversion. After fulfilling these duties at Madrid a year and
a half, he therefore sought another appointment, and obtained
one in the Council of Military Orders, more agreeable to his
inclinations. In this office it was his duty to attend to the
affairs of the four military orders of Spain, and in his visits
to their properties and other places on their behalf, he was
entrusted with various commissions, which he fulfilled with
his accustomed zeal. In those visits he had to go much to
his native province, and he took advantage of his influence to
make roads, which were much needed there, and the benefits
of which he lived to see appreciated. He incited the members
of the Patriotic Society of Oviedo, and others connected
with the Asturias, to explore the mineral wealth of the country,
rich in mines of coal and iron, then scarcely known. For
the study of such pursuits he founded the Asturian Institute,
and raised subscriptions to have two young men educated
abroad in mathematics and mining, who were afterwards to
teach those sciences at the Institute. Every day of his life
indeed seems to have been employed on some object of public
utility, or in studies connected with such objects; following
the ancient maxim to do nothing trifling or imperfectly:&mdash;Μ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>ηδὲν
ἐνέργημα εἰκῆ, μηδὲν ἄλλως ἢ κατὰ θεωρήμα συμπληρωτικὸν
τῆς τέχνης ἐνεργεῖθω.</p>

<p>Though exact in the fulfilment of his official duties, and
other various commissions entrusted to him by the government
to report on the state of the provinces, it is wonderful
to consider the industry with which he followed other pursuits.
He studied botany and architecture, on which he wrote
several treatises; and though each of those subjects would have
been a sufficient task for ordinary men, to him they were only
relaxations from his favourite science of political economy.</p>

<p>Bent on the promotion of law and other reforms in the
state, he became connected with the Conde de Cabarrus, who,
though a Frenchman by birth, had obtained high employments
in Spain, and who, as a person of superior talent and discernment,
was also convinced of the necessity of such measures.
As too often is the case with able and honest statesmen, the
Conde de Cabarrus fell, while attempting to effect these reforms,
under the intrigues of his enemies, and Jovellanos became
involved in his disgrace. He had been sent, in 1790,
into the provinces in fulfilment of the duties of his office;
when, having heard on the road of his friend’s ill fortune, he
returned at once to offer him whatever assistance he might
have in his power. He had, however, no sooner arrived in
Madrid, where the Conde was under arrest, than, without
being allowed to communicate with him, Jovellanos received a
royal order to return immediately to his province.</p>

<p>The terms in which this order was conveyed convinced
Jovellanos that he was to share in the disgrace of his friend,
and to consider himself banished from court. He therefore
proceeded philosophically to settle himself in his paternal
abode with his brother, their father being now deceased, with
his books and effects, and engaged in the improvement of
their family estates. His expectations proved correct, as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
this honourable exile he had to pass seven years, though not
altogether unemployed, as he had several commissions entrusted
to him similar to those he had previously discharged.
But still Jovellanos, unbowed by political reverses, continued
the same ardent promoter of public improvement. For the
Asturian Institute, which he had founded for the purpose of
teaching principally mineralogy and metallurgy, and which
he personally superintended, he wrote his very able work on
Public Instruction, and compiled elementary grammars of
the French and English languages, in which he showed himself
proficient to a degree truly astonishing.</p>

<p>In his official duties, having to go carefully in inspection
over the Asturias and other neighbouring provinces, he noted
his observations in diaries, which have been fortunately preserved,
and which contain much valuable information. In
these he has gathered all he could learn relative to the productions
of the provinces, and the state in which he found
them and the people, as embodied in his reports thereon to
the government, with an account of the ancient remains and
public buildings, making copies of whatever he found most
interesting in the archives of the several convents, cathedrals
and corporations. Some of these copies now possess a peculiar
value, from the damages that have since accrued to many of
the originals from time and the events of the subsequent wars.</p>

<p>If it were not for the disparagement of being considered in
banishment, Jovellanos could have felt himself contented.
He had not only honourable employment, as before stated,
but he also received several notices of approbation from the
government, especially as regarded the Institute, to which
notices he perhaps paid a higher regard than they deserved.
He seems himself to have felt this; for in one of his letters he
writes&mdash;“I will not deny that I desire some public mark of
appreciation by the government, to gain by it that kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
sanction which merit needs in the opinion of some weak
minds. But I see that this is a vain suggestion, and that
posterity will not judge me by my titles, but by my works.”</p>

<p>This was written on a rumour having reached Gijon of the
probability of his being soon restored to favour at court.
Those under whose intrigues he had fallen had now passed
away in their turn: a favourite of a more powerful grade was
in the ascendant, Godoy, the Prince of the Peace, to whose
mind had been suggested the advisability of gathering round
him persons of acknowledged probity and knowledge, for the
support of his government. Jovellanos had returned home,
in October 1797, from one of his journeys of inspection, when
he found the whole town in a state of rejoicing. On inquiring
the cause, he was told it was because news had been received
of his nomination as ambassador to Russia. A few days
afterwards the rejoicings were renewed, on the further intelligence
of his being nominated a member of the government
itself, as Minister of Grace and Justice.</p>

<p>In this office it might have been hoped that a happier
career was before him; but evil fortune on the contrary now
followed him, and more fatally than ever. His former banishment
from court was owing to the endeavours he had made
to remove those abuses into which all human institutions
have a tendency to fall, rendering frequently necessary a correction
of those abuses, to preserve what was most valuable
in the institutions themselves. His next misfortune arose
from personal differences with the reigning favourite, whose
greater influence it was his error not to have perceived.
Jovellanos had been restored to favour at the instance of
Godoy; but as this was without his seeking, he felt himself
under no obligation to maintain him as the head of the government,
for which he was totally unfit. Jovellanos joined
in an opposition to him, which for a short time succeeded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
depriving Godoy of office. But his influence at court continued,
and thus Jovellanos was in his turn dismissed, after
holding the office of minister only about eight months, and
ordered to return to Gijon.</p>

<p>Unhappily the favourite carried his resentment further;
and Jovellanos was, on the 13th of March, 1801, arrested in
his bed at an early hour of the morning, and sent as a prisoner
through the country to Barcelona, thence to Mallorca,
where first in the Carthusian convent, and afterwards in the
castle of Bellver more strictly, he was closely confined, without
any regard paid to his demands to know the accusation
against him. Here his health was severely affected, as well
as his feelings outraged, by the unjust treatment to which he
was subjected. Still he was not one to sink under such evils.
He was rather one of those “who, going through the valley
of misery, make it a well.” He turned accordingly to the
resources of literature, and employed himself in writing and
translating from Latin and French several valuable treatises
on architecture, and other works, on the history of the island,
and of the convent, besides several poems, among which the
Epistle to <a href="#note3" title="See note">Bermudez, his biographer</a>, deserves particular notice.</p>

<p>Another work he then wrote is no less deserving of mention,
showing the attention he had paid to English affairs,
entitled “A Letter on English Architecture, and that called
Gothic,” in which he treated of English architecture from
the time of the Druids, dividing it into the Saxon, Gothic
and modern periods. He describes the buildings according
to the epochs, especially St. Paul’s and others of the seventeenth
century, coming down to the picturesque style of
gardening then adopted in England, with notices of the
different sculptors, painters and engravers, as well as architects,
and also of the authors who had written on the Fine
Arts in England. This work has not been published, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Bermudez states he had the manuscript.</p>

<p>After being seven years a prisoner, Jovellanos was in 1808
released on the abdication of Charles IV. and the consequent
fall of Godoy. This release was announced to him in terms
of official brevity, and he replied by an earnest demand to be
subjected to a trial, for the purpose of having the cause of
his imprisonment made manifest. Before, however, an answer
could be returned, Ferdinand had, under Napoleon’s dictation,
also ceased to reign, and Jovellanos was called upon to
take a prominent place in the intrusive government of king
Joseph. This he could not be supposed from his antecedent
character to be willing to accept. On the contrary, being
chosen by the National party a member of the Central Junta,
he engaged with his accustomed energy on the other side
until the Regency was formed, principally under his influence,
to carry on the struggles for independence.</p>

<p>On this being effected, Jovellanos wished to retire to his
native city apart from public affairs. At his advanced age,
with cataracts formed in his eyes, and after his laborious life
and painful imprisonment, rest was necessary for him; but
he could not attain it. One of his first efforts in the Central
Junta was to draw up a paper on the form of government to
be adopted, and this he strongly recommended to be founded
as nearly as possible on the model of the English constitution.
But he was far too enlightened for the race of men
with whom he had to act, and his prepossessions for English
institutions were made a reproach against him, observes the
editor of the last edition of his works, even by those who
were striving to introduce the principles of the Constituent
Assembly into Spain.</p>

<p>The miserable intrigues and jealousies of the leading members
of the National party caused Jovellanos much anxiety.
But he had fulfilled his duties as a Deputy, and those having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
ceased, he left Cadiz in February, 1810, to return to the
Asturias, in a small sailing vessel. After a long and dangerous
passage, during which they were in great danger of
shipwreck, they arrived at Muros in Galicia, in which province
he had to remain more than a year, in consequence of
the Asturias being in the possession of the French, to whom
he had now become doubly obnoxious.</p>

<p>In July, 1811, however, the French having left that part
of Spain, Jovellanos was enabled to return to his native city,
where he was again received as he always had been with
every token of popular respect. He seems to have been
always looked upon there with undeviating favour and gratitude,
as their most honourable citizen and public benefactor.
No one knew of his coming, says his biographer, but he was
observed to enter the church, and kneel before the altar near
his family burying-place, when the whole town was roused
simultaneously, and a spontaneous illumination of the houses
took place, with other tokens of public congratulations and
rejoicing.</p>

<p>Here he now hoped to have a peaceful asylum for his latter
years, engaged in the objects of public utility for which he
had formerly laboured. But those labours were to be begun
again. His favourite “Asturian Institute,” which he truly
said, in one of his discourses, was identified with his existence,
had been totally dismantled and used for barracks by the
French. Having obtained authority from the Regency to
do so, he began to put the building again into repair, and
collect together the teachers and scholars. Having done
this, he announced by circulars that it would be reopened
the 20th of November following, when the news of the
French returning compelled him again to fly on the 6th of
that month. He set sail in a miserable coasting vessel for
Ribadeo, where a ship was ready to take him to Cadiz or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
England as he might desire, in virtue of instructions given
by the Regency, and in accordance with the English government.
But further misfortunes only awaited him. The vessel
in which he had to take refuge was cast on shore in a storm
near the small port of Vega, on the confines of Asturias; and
there, worn out with fatigue, and under a pulmonary affection,
brought on by exposure to the weather, he died the 27th of
November, 1811, a few days after his landing.</p>

<p>The news of his death was spread rapidly through Spain,
notwithstanding the interrupted state of communications,
and was everywhere received with regret as a national calamity.
Those who had opposed his views did justice to the
uprightness of his motives and character; and the Cortes,
now assembled, passed a decree, by which in favour of his
patriotism and public services, he was declared Benemerito
de la Patria. This beautiful and classical acknowledgement
of his worth was then also remarkable as a novelty, though
it has been since rendered less honourable, by being awarded
to others little deserving of peculiar distinction.</p>

<p>The life of Jovellanos, as intimately connected with the
history of his country, is well deserving of extended study.
But our province is rather to consider him as a poet. Eminent
as a statesman for unimpeachable integrity and for wise
administration of justice, he carried prudent reforms into
every department under his control, in which, though subjected
to many attacks, he proved himself, by a memoir
published shortly before his death, in justification of his
public conduct, to have been fully warranted. This memoir,
for heartfelt eloquence, deserves to be ranked with Burke’s
Letter to the Duke of Bedford. Jovellanos has been compared
by his countrymen to Cicero. A writer in the Foreign
Quarterly Review has instituted an ingenious parallel between
him and Montesquieu. With either, or with Burke, he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>may
be observed to have possessed the philosophy and feeling,
which give eloquence its chief value and effect.</p>

<p>As a prose writer, Jovellanos, for elegance of style and
depth of thought, may be pronounced without a rival in
Spanish literature. As a dramatist, he only gave the public
a tragedy and comedy, both of which continue in much
favour with the public. The latter, “The Honourable Delinquent”
is particularly esteemed; but it is a melodrame
rather than a comedy, according to our conceptions. It turns
on the principal character having been forced into fighting a
duel, and who, having killed his opponent, is sentenced to
die; but after the usual suspenses receives a pardon from the
king. There are several interesting scenes and much good
writing in the piece; but no particular delineation of character,
to bring it any more than the other into the higher
class of dramatic art. It has, however, been observed, that
it only needs to have been written in verse to make it a perfect
performance, and this alone shows the hold it must have
on the Spanish reader.</p>

<p>As a poet, Jovellanos is chiefly to be commemorated for
his Satires. Two of these, in which he lashes the vices and
follies of society at Madrid,&mdash;“girt with the silent crimes of
capitals,”&mdash;are pronounced by the critic in the Madrid Review
to be “highly finished” compositions. They were, in fact,
the only poems he himself published, and those anonymously.
With the strength of Juvenal, they have also his faults, and
abound too much in local allusions to be suited for translation.
In somewhat the same style were several epistles he
addressed to different friends, of which the one written to
his friend and biographer Bermudez has been chosen for
this work, as most characteristic of the author. Like his
other Satires, it is written in blank verse; which style, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
not entirely unknown in Spain, he had the <a href="#note4" title="See note">merit of first
bringing into favour</a>. He probably gained his predilection
for it from his study of Milton, for whose works he had
great admiration, and of whose Paradise Lost he translated
the first book into Spanish verse.</p>

<p>The Epistle to Bermudez is remarkable as written with
much earnestness, in censure not only of the common vices
and follies of mankind, but in also going beyond ordinary
satirists into the sphere of the moralist, to censure the faults
of the learned. What our great modern preacher Dr. Chalmers
has termed the “practical atheism” of the learned, was
indeed the subject of rebuke from many English writers, as
Young and Cowper, but may be looked for in vain in the
works of others. Jovellanos had no doubt read the former,
at least in the translation of his friend Escoiquiz, and meditated
on the sentiment,&mdash;“An undevout astronomer is mad,”
even if not in the original. It can scarcely be supposed that
he was so well acquainted with English literature as to have
read Cowper; but there are several passages in his Epistles
of similar sentiments. The praise of wisdom especially, in
the one to Bermudez,&mdash;by which we may understand, was
meant the wisdom urged by the kingly preacher of Jerusalem,
or the rule of conduct founded on right principles, in
opposition to mere learning,&mdash;is also that of our Christian
poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one,</div>
<div class="verse">Have ofttimes no connexion. Knowledge dwells</div>
<div class="verse">In heads replete with thoughts of other men;</div>
<div class="verse">Wisdom in minds attentive to their own.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In his hours of leisure, Jovellanos employed himself in
composing occasional verses at times, for the amusement of
the society in which he lived, without thinking of their being
ever sought for publication. These, however, have been lately
gathered together with much industry and exactness in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
last edition of his collected works, published by Mellado at
Madrid in five volumes, 1845. As the last and fullest, it is
also the best collection of them, four other editions of them
previously published having been comparatively very deficient
with regard to them. Besides those, there were various reprints
of several others of his works, which were all received
with much favour, both in Spain and abroad.</p>

<p>Jovellanos was never married, and in private life seems to
have considered himself under the obligations of the profession
for which he was originally intended. His character
altogether is one to which it would be difficult to find a
parallel, and is an honour to Spain as well as to Spanish
literature. His virtues are now unreservedly admitted by all
parties of his countrymen, who scarcely ever name him except
with the epithet of the illustrious Jovellanos, to which designation
he is indeed justly entitled, no less for his writings,
than for his many public and private virtues and services to
his country. These may be forgotten in the claims of other
generations and succeeding statesmen; but his writings must
ever remain to carry his memory wherever genius and worth
can be duly appreciated.</p>

<p>The charge of writing a memoir of Jovellanos was entrusted
by the Historical Society of Madrid to Cean Bermudez,
who fulfilled it with affectionate zeal, Madrid, 1814; several
other notices of his life have appeared in Spain, including
that by Quintana, which has been copied by Wolf. The
English reader will find an excellent one in the Foreign
Quarterly Review, No. 10, February, 1830; and the Spanish
scholar a further very eloquent encomium on his talents and
merits in Quintana’s second Introduction to his collection of
Spanish Poetry.</p>

<div class="verse">Arise, Bermudo, bid thy soul beware:</div>
<div class="verse">Thee raging Fortune watches to ensnare;</div>

<span class="smaller">TOMAS DE IRIARTE.</span></h3>

<p>Of all the modern Spanish poets, Iriarte seems to have obtained
for his writings the widest European reputation. He
was born the 18th September 1750, at Teneriffe in the Canary
Islands, where his family had been some time settled, though
the name shows it to have been of Basque origin. His uncle,
Juan de Iriarte, also a native of the same place, was one of the
most learned men of his age, and to him the subject of this
memoir was indebted for much of the knowledge he acquired,
and means of attaining the eminence in literature he succeeded
him in possessing. Juan de Iriarte had been partly
educated in France, and had afterwards resided some time in
England, so as to acquire a full knowledge of the language
and literature of those countries. He was also a proficient
in classical learning, and wrote Latin with great precision, as
his writings, published by his nephew after his death, evince;
Madrid, two volumes, 4to. 1774. Having been appointed
keeper of the Royal Library at Madrid, he enriched it with
many valuable works, in upwards of 2000 MSS. and 10,000
volumes. He was an active member of the Royal Spanish
Academy, and one of the principal assistants in compiling the
valuable dictionary and grammar published by that learned
Society, as well as other works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>At the instance of this uncle, Tomas Iriarte went to Madrid
in the beginning of 1764, when not yet fourteen years of
age, and under that relative’s able guidance completed his
studies, learning at the same time the English and other
modern languages. He was already far advanced in a knowledge
of classical literature, and it is stated that some Latin
verses he wrote, on leaving his native place, showed such
proficiency as to surprise his friends, and make them entertain
great expectations of his future success. Some of his
Latin compositions, published afterwards among his works,
prove him to have been a scholar of very considerable acquirements.
Classical literature does not seem in modern
times to be much studied in Spain, and Iriarte is the only
distinguished writer among the modern Spanish poets who
can be pointed out as conspicuous for such attainments.
Thus they have failed in apprehending one of the chief beauties
of modern poetry, so remarkable in Milton and Byron,
and our other great poets, who enrich their works with references
that remind us of what had most delighted us in
those of antiquity.</p>

<p>In 1771 his uncle died, and Tomas Iriarte, who had already
been acting for him in one of his offices as Interpreter to the
Government, was appointed to succeed him in it. He was
afterwards, in 1776, appointed Keeper of the Archives of the
Council of War; and these offices, with the charge of a paper
under the influence of the government, seem to have been
the only public employments he held. From one of his
epistles, however, he appears to have succeeded to his uncle’s
property, and thus to have had the means as also the leisure
to give much of his time to the indulgence of literary tastes.
He was very fond of paintings and of music, to which he
showed his predilection, not only by his ability to play on
several instruments, but also by writing a long didacti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>c poem
on the art, entitled ‘Musica.’ This he seems to have considered
as giving him his principal claim to be ranked as a
poet, though the world preferred his other writings.</p>

<p>When yet under twenty years of age, Iriarte had already
appeared as a writer of plays, some of which met with considerable
approbation. Of these it will be sufficient for us
here to observe, that Moratin, the first great dramatic poet
of Spain in modern times, pronounced one of them, ‘The
Young Gentleman Pacified,’ to have been “the first original
comedy the Spanish theatre had seen written according to
the most essential rules dictated by philosophy and good
criticism.”</p>

<p>Besides several original plays, Iriarte translated others
from the French, from which language he also translated the
‘New Robinson’ of Campe, which passed through several editions.
From Virgil he translated into Spanish verse the first
four books of the Æneid, and from Horace the Epistle to the
Pisos. These, though censured by some of his contemporaries
so as to excite his anger, were altogether too superior
to those attacks to have required the vindication of them he
thought proper to publish. Horace seems to have been his
favourite author; but he had not learned from him his philosophical
equanimity, wherewith to pass over in silent endurance
the minor miseries of life. Thus he allowed himself,
throughout his short career, to be too much affected by those
ungenerous attacks, which mediocrity is so apt to make on
superior merit. The names of those censurers are now principally
remembered by his notices of their writings; an honour,
which men of genius, in their hours of irritation, too
often confer on unworthy opponents. Thus a large portion
of his collected works consists of these controversial notices,
which, as usual in such cases, only impair the favourable
effect produced by the remainder on the mind of the reader.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Those works were first published in a collected form in six
volumes, in 1786; afterwards in eight volumes, in 1805.</p>

<p>From Iriarte’s poetical epistles, which are eleven in number,
he appears to have been a person of a very kindly disposition,
as Quintana describes him, living in friendly intercourse
with the principal literary characters of Spain, especially
with the amiable and ill-fated Cadahalso, to whom, in
one of those epistles, he dedicated his translations from Horace.
The others also are mainly on personal topics, and
display his character advantageously, though, as poetical
compositions, they have not been received so favourably as
some of his other works.</p>

<p>The fame of Iriarte may be said to rest on his literary
fables, which have attained a popularity, both at home and
abroad, equalled by few other works. They are eighty-two
in number, and all original, having, as their title indicates, a
special reference to literary questions, though they are also
all sufficiently pointed to bear on those of ordinary life. Like
Sir Joshua Reynolds’s Discourses on Painting, they convey
general instructions to all, while professing an application to
one particular pursuit. They are written with much vivacity
and ease, yet with an appropriate terseness that adds to their
effect. Martinez de la Rosa, equally eminent as a statesman,
a poet and a critic, observes of them, that if he had not left
compositions of any other class, they would have extended his
reputation as a poet; and adds, “that they abound in beauties,
though frequently wanting in poetical warmth, so as to recommend
this valuable collection, unique in its class, as one
of which Spanish literature has to be proud.”</p>

<p>Of these fables, first published in 1782, so many editions
have appeared, that it would be a very difficult task to enumerate
them. There is scarcely a provincial town in Spain,
of any consequence, in which they have not been reprinted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Several editions have appeared in France, two in New York,
and three in Boston, where they have been used in teaching
Spanish. Several of the fables have been imitated by Florian,
and translations have been made into other languages. Of
these translations, one in French verse was published by M.
Lanos, Paris, 1801, and another, in prose, by M. L’Homandie,
ibid. 1804: into German they were translated by Bertuch,
Leipzic, so early as 1788, and into Portuguese, by Velladoli,
in 1801.</p>

<p>I am not aware of more than one edition of them in England,
that published by Dulau, 1809; but there have been
no fewer than three translations of them into English verse;
first by Mr. Belfour, London, 1804, another by Mr. Andrews,
ibid. 1835, and a third by Mr. Rockliff, ibid. 1851.</p>

<p>The same popularity attended another work which Iriarte
prepared for the instruction of youth, named ‘Historical
Lessons,’ published posthumously, about twenty editions of
which have since appeared, principally from its having been
adopted as a text-book for schools. Of this also an edition
has been published in London by Boosey, and a translation
into English. Iriarte’s industry appears to have been of the
most practical character, and his endeavours were as wisely
as they were unremittingly directed to make his countrymen
wiser and better in their future generations. If a man’s
worth may be estimated by such labours, few persons have
ever lived who were so entitled to the gratitude of posterity,
as few have ever effected so much as he did in the short career
that was afforded him.</p>

<p>In private life, in the leisure allowed from his studies and
duties, he indulged much, as has been already stated, in the
recreation of music; and in praise and explanation of that
favourite art he wrote his largest work, ‘Music,’ a didactic
poem, in five cantos. Of this work, which was first publis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>hed
in 1780, the fifth separate edition appeared in 1805, since
which I have not heard of any other. It has, however, had the
good fortune to be translated into several foreign languages;
into German by Bertuch, in 1789; into Italian by the Abbé
Garzia, Venice, 1789; into French by Grainville, Paris, 1800;
and into English by Mr. Belfour, London, 1807. The last-mentioned
translation is made with much exactness and elegance
into heroic verse; though, as the original had the fault
usual to all didactic poems of not rising to any high poetical
power, the translation must share the fault to at least an
equal extent.</p>

<p>In the Italian version, a letter is quoted from the celebrated
Metastasio, in which he speaks of the style of Iriarte’s
poem as “so harmonious, perspicuous and easy, as to unite
the precision of a treatise with the beauties common to
poetry.” It is said also that Metastasio further pronounced
the poem to be “not only excellent, but to be considered uncommon,
in having successfully treated a subject so difficult,
and apparently so little adapted to poetry.” It is to be observed
that Iriarte had warmly eulogized Metastasio in the
book, so as to merit the commendation. The first canto is confined
to treating the subject artistically, and will therefore
prove less to the taste of the general reader than the other
cantos, which are of a more interesting character, and may be
read with pleasure by persons who do not understand music
as a science. The third canto especially is written with much
spirit in its praise, as connected with devotion. The second
canto treats of the passions as they may be expressed by
music, including martial music. The fourth minutely discusses
theatrical music, with its excellences and defects.
The fifth explains it, as calculated for the amusement of
societies, or individuals in solitude. The poem concludes
with pointing out what ought to be the study of a good co<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>mposer,
and by a proposal for the establishment of an academy
of music, or scientific body of musicians, anticipating the
benefit to science that would result from such an institution.</p>

<p>This poem, the ‘Musica,’ and the Epistles, are written in a
very favourite style of versification in Spain, denominated the
Silva, which consists of lines of eleven syllables, varied occasionally
with others of seven, rhyming at the pleasure of the
writer. The ‘Literary Fables’ are written in various metres;
Martinez de la Rosa observes in upwards of forty different
kinds, appropriate to the characteristics of the subjects, which
may be more perceptible to a native ear than to a foreigner’s.
It is certainly true that this gives a variety to the work which
is well suited to the purposes the author had in view. He
was wise enough to know that truths hidden in the garb of
fiction will often be felt effectually, where grave precepts
would not avail,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Καὶ τοῦ τι καὶ Βρότων φρενὰς</div>
<div class="verse">Ὑπὲρ τὸν ἀληθῆ λόγον,</div>
<div class="verse">Δεδαιδαλμένοι ψεύδεσι ποικίλοις</div>
<div class="verse">Ἐξαπάτωντι μύθοι,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and thus conveyed his lessons in examples, with a moral, which
could be quickly understood and easily remembered.</p>

<p>With regard to the objection made to these fables, that
they are often deficient in poetical warmth or colouring, it
may be observed that the subjects would scarcely admit of
any. Iriarte was certainly a writer of more poetic taste than
talent, and it must be acknowledged that his genius, judging
by the works he left, was not one to soar to the higher flights
of poetry. He felt this himself, as he intimates in his Epistle
to his brother; and, choosing a subject like Music for a didactic
poem, or writing familiar epistles on occasional subjects,
did not give himself much scope for fancy, much less for
passion. But as applied to the fables, the objection was u<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>nnecessary.
If they deserved praise for their vivacity of style,
that very circumstance, independent of the subjects, rendered
them passionless, ἀπαθέστατα, as Longinus remarks, where
stronger feelings could scarcely be brought into connexion
with such discussions. The great difficulty in such cases
is, when metres are chosen to suit the subject, abounding in
pyrrhics, trochees, and such measures, as the same great
critic adds, to guard, lest the sense be lost in too much regard
to the sound, raising only attention to the rhythm, instead
of exciting any feeling in the minds of the hearers.</p>

<p>Of the five fables chosen for translation, the two first were
taken from Bouterwek, and the third on account of its having
been particularly noticed by Martinez de la Rosa. The
Epistle to his Brother was selected partly on account of its
notices of other countries, as a foreigner’s judgement of
them; and partly as being most characteristic of the writer,
showing his tastes and dispositions more perhaps than the
rest. The reader generally feels most interested in such
parts of the works of favourite writers, especially when their
private history gives the imagination a right to ask sympathy
for their sufferings.</p>

<p>Nothing is to be found in Iriarte’s works to show any
peculiar opinions on religion, though the tendency of his
mind is everywhere clearly seen, as leading to freedom of
thought, instead of subjection to dogmas. In his poem on
Music, as already intimated, some devotional rather than free-thinking
principles are developed; yet it is said that it was
from a suspicion of his being affected by the French philosophy
of the day he fell under the censure of the Inquisition,
and was seized in 1786, and imprisoned three years in the
dungeons of that institution. What was the particular offence
imputed to him has not been stated. It could be no question
of a political character, for he was in the employment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
government, and was amenable to it for any misdeeds. It
probably was from some private cause, under the cloak of a
question of faith, that he had to undergo this imprisonment,
during which it is said he had to submit to severe penances
before he could obtain his liberty. After he had obtained it,
he returned to his studies and wrote further, a monologue,
entitled ‘Guzman,’ and some Latin maccaronic verses on the
bad taste of some writers then in vogue. But his spirits
were no doubt broken down, as his health and strength
were undermined; and thus it was that he died two years
after, though his death was imputed to his sedentary habits
and gout, the 17th of September, 1791, when he had just
completed his forty-first year.</p>

<p>This untimely death was a serious loss to Spanish literature.
With his great and varied acquirements and unremitting
industry, the world might have expected still more
valuable works from him, when, at the age of thirty-six, in
the best period of a man’s existence for useful labours, he
was cast into that dungeon, from which he seems to have
been permitted to come out only to die. The last Auto da fe
in Spain was celebrated in 1781; but the Inquisition had
other victims whose sufferings were no less to be deplored,
though not made known. If Iriarte was one, he had unquestionably
the consciousness of being enabled to feel, though
not dying “an aged man,” yet that in his comparatively
short life, he had not lived in vain for his own good name,
and the benefit of posterity.</p>

<span class="smaller">JUAN MELENDEZ VALDES.</span></h3>

<p>For a hundred years after the time of Calderon de la Barca,
who died in 1687, there appeared in Spain no writer of
sufficient merit to be classed among those eminent characters,
who had done so much honour to Spanish literature
in the seventeenth century. Verses were published in sufficient
abundance, which found readers and even admirers,
merely from the necessity the public felt of having something
to read and to admire, as of the fashion of the day. But they
were written with a perversion of taste and a deficiency of
talent, which was truly astonishing, in the successors of such
authors, as had immediately preceded them.</p>

<p>This depression of literature, however, could not be expected
to continue long, among a people of such imaginative
and deep passioned character as the Spanish, whose native
genius was by far too buoyant, to be affected for any length
of time by inferior models, even under dynastic influences.
Accordingly, towards the end of the eighteenth century, it
might have become apparent to an attentive observer, that
another order of writers was about to be called forth, and
that the nation was prepared to welcome the advent of true
genius whenever it was to be recognized. Learned societies
had been established throughout Spain; education on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
sound basis had been sedulously promoted; and the country
was wealthy, and sufficiently flourishing to give incitement to
the arts, which are the attendants of public prosperity.</p>

<p>At this epoch appeared Melendez Valdes, the restorer of
Spanish poetry, as his admirers with much justice termed
him; who then showed by his writings, that the old inspiration
of the national genius was yet capable of being revived
in all its former grace and strength; and who by the influence
of his example further roused the energies of other
men of genius to follow in his steps.</p>

<p>This highly gifted poet was born the 11th of March, 1754,
at Ribera del Fresno in the province of Estremadura, where
his parents were of what was called noble families, and, what
was more important, in respectable circumstances. The good
disposition noticed in the son determined them to destine
him for study, and to award him a becoming education.
Thus, having learned the rudiments of Latin at home, he was
sent to study philosophy, or what was called philosophy, at
Madrid, under the charge of the Dominican Fathers of St.
Thomas, where his application and advancement gained him
the esteem of his tutors and fellow-pupils. Thence he was
sent by his parents in 1770 to Segovia, to study with his
only brother, who was private secretary to the bishop of that
city, and with whom he was confirmed in that fondness for
reading, and taste for acquiring books, which might be called
the passion of his whole life. The bishop, who was a distant
relation, pleased with his talents and inclination for study,
sent him in 1772 to Salamanca, the alma mater of Spain,
and assisted him to proceed in the study of law, in which
he distinguished himself wherever he had an opportunity; so
that, says his biographer, “appearing absorbed in the pursuit
of that career, no one would have judged him the same
young man, whose inclination for poetry and learning was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
soon after to place him at the head of the elegant literature
of his country.”</p>

<p>Fortunately for Melendez, continues his biographer, there
happened then to be at Salamanca Don Josè de Cadalso, “a
man celebrated for extensive erudition, combined with more
than ordinary talent for poetry and letters, and a zeal for the
glory and advancement of his country, learned in the school,
and under the inspiration of virtue. Generous and affable,
always lively, and at times satirical without branching off
into maliciousness, his conversation was kind and instructive,
and his principles indulgent and steadfast.” This eminent
individual, already well known in the literary world by several
works published in 1772 and 1773, immediately recognized
the value of Melendez: he took him to his house to live with
him, showed him the beauties and defects of the older writers,
taught him how to imitate them, and opened to him the
road to become acquainted with the literature of the learned
nations of Europe. “He afforded him an instruction yet
more precious, in the beautiful example he gave him to love
all writers of merit, to rise superior to envy, and to cultivate
letters without degrading them by unworthy disputations.
The eulogies Cadalso bestowed on his contemporaries are a
public testimony of this noble character; and the works of
Melendez, where there is not a single line detracting from
the merit of any one, and his whole literary career, exempt
from all attack, show how he profited by the lessons of his
master.”</p>

<p>The Anacreontic style, in which Cadalso excelled, was also
that first cultivated by Melendez; and the former, seeing the
progress of his pupil, and the first efforts of his Muse, unreservedly
acknowledged him his superior, and in prose and
verse announced him as the restorer of good taste and the
better studies of the University. This kindly u<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>nion was
maintained until the death of Cadalso, at the siege of
Gibraltar; and the “Elegiac song of Melendez on this misfortune,
will be, as long as the Spanish language endures, a
monument of affection and gratitude, as well as an example
of high and beautiful poetry.”</p>

<p>Beyond the instructions which he received from Cadalso,
Melendez was aided by the example and counsels of other distinguished
persons then residing at Salamanca, among whom
were two, favourably known as writers of verse, <a href="#note13" title="See note">Iglesias and
Gonzalez</a>. These, though they were soon eclipsed by the
young poet, admitted him to their friendship. By the latter
he was brought into communication with the illustrious
Jovellanos, then Judge of the High Court at Seville; and
between them soon was instituted a correspondence, which
has been in great part preserved, though as yet unpublished;
a valuable monument, says Quintana, in which are seen,
“livingly portrayed, the candour, the modesty and virtuous
feelings of the poet, the alternate progress of his studies,
the different attempts in which he essayed his talents, and
above all, the profound respect and almost idolatry with
which he revered his Mæcenas. There may be seen how he
employed his time and varied his tasks. At first he applied
himself to Greek, and began to translate Homer and Theocritus
into verse; but learning the immense difficulty of the
undertaking, and not stimulated to it by the bent of his
genius, he shortly abandoned it.”</p>

<p>He then dedicated himself to the English language and
literature, for which he was said to have ever had an exceeding
great predilection, observing, “that to the Essay on the
Human Understanding, he should owe all his life the little he
might know how to acquire.” As books came to his hands,
he went on reading and forming his judgements upon them,
the which he transmitted to his friend. Thus “by all th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>e
means in his power he endeavoured to acquire and increase
that treasury of ideas, which so much contributes to perfection
in the art of writing, and without which verses are
nothing more than frivolous sounds.”</p>

<p>His application to study, however, soon proved more than
his health and strength would permit. He was obliged to
leave Salamanca, and repair to the banks of the Tormes,
which he has made famous in song, and there, by long attention
to the regimen imposed on him, he fortunately recovered.
About this time his brother died in 1777, their parents
having died previously; and Melendez suffered much grief,
as might naturally be expected, on being thus left alone
of his family, the more painful in his state of health. Jovellanos
urged him to join him at Seville, but he declined the
invitation, observing, that “the law of friendship itself, which
commands us to avail ourselves of a friend in necessity, also
commands that without it, we should not take advantage of
his confidence.”</p>

<p>Study, to which he now returned to engage himself with
more intensity than ever, was the best alleviant of his sorrow,
and time as usual at length allayed it. “He then gave himself
up to the reading and study of the English poets: Pope
and Young enchanted him. Of the former, he said that four
lines of his ‘Essay on Man’ were worth more, taught more,
and deserved more praise than all his own compositions.”
The latter he attempted to imitate, and in effect did so, in
the poem on ‘Night and Solitude,’ but in remitting it to his
friend, expressed with much feeling his sense of its deficiencies
compared with the original. Thomson also he studied,
and Gesner, in his lonely exercises by the Tormes, and acknowledged
how much he was indebted to the former for
many thoughts with which he subsequently enriched his
pastoral poems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus having prepared himself to appear before the literary
world as a candidate for fame, an opportunity soon occurred
for him to obtain distinction. The Spanish Academy had
been proposing subjects for prizes, and then having given
one for an Eclogue, ‘On the happiness of a country life,’
Melendez felt himself in his element, and sent in his Essay
for the prize. This succeeded in receiving the first. The
second was awarded to Iriarte, who showed his mortification
on account of the preference, more sensibly than was becoming,
under the circumstances.</p>

<p>In the following year, 1781, Melendez went to Madrid,
where his friend Jovellanos had already been appointed
Councillor of the Military Orders, when for the first time
they met. Melendez was already in the road to fame, which
his friend had foretold for him; and Jovellanos, delighted
with the realization of his hopes and endeavours, received
him into his house, introduced him to his society, and took
every opportunity of advancing his interests. It was the
custom of the Academy of San Fernando to give triennial
celebrations, with much solemnity, for the distribution of
prizes, when eloquence, poetry and music were tasked to do
honour to the fine arts. One of these celebrations was about
to take place; Jovellanos was engaged to pronounce a discourse,
and Melendez was invited to exercise his genius on
the same subject, as the first literary characters of preceding
times had already given the example. Melendez acceded,
and delivered accordingly his Ode on the Glory of the Arts,
which was received with rapturous admiration, and ever since
seems to have been considered his masterpiece.</p>

<p>In the midst of these successes, Melendez received the
Professorship of Humanities in his University, and in the
following year, 1782, proceeded to the degree of Licentiate,
and in 1783 to that of Doctor of Law, having shortly befo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>re
the last married a lady of one of the principal families of
Salamanca. But as his professorship gave him little occupation,
and his marriage no family, he remained free to continue
his favourite studies.</p>

<p>In 1784, on the occasion of peace being made with England,
and the birth of twin Infantes, to give hopes of secure
succession to the throne, the city of Madrid prepared magnificent
celebrations of rejoicings, and among the rest, a prize
was proposed for the two best dramatic pieces that might be
offered within sixty days, under the condition that they
should be original, appropriate, and capable of theatrical
pomp and ornament. Out of fifty-seven dramas that were
offered, the prize was awarded to the one sent in by Melendez,
‘The Bridals of Comacho the Rich,’ a pastoral
comedy, which, however, though abounding in poetical passages,
was found on representation wanting in effect, so as to
be coldly received on the stage, where it has not since been
attempted.</p>

<p>This ill-success gave occasion to several detractors of
Melendez to pour forth the effusions of envy or disappointment
against him, to which he gave no other answer than by
the publication of his poems in a collected form. This was
in 1785; and the manner in which they were received, it
could be said, had had no parallel in Spain. Four editions,
of which three were furtive, were at once taken up, and all
classes of persons seemed to have the book in hand, commenting
on its excellences. The lovers of ancient poetry,
who saw so happily renewed the graces of Garcilasso, of
Leon and Herrera, and “even improved in taste and perfection,”
saluted Melendez as the restorer of the Castillian
Muses, and hailed the banishment of the prosaic style which
had previously prevailed. The applauses extended beyond
the kingdom, and found especially in Italy the admiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
repeated, as well as in France and England, where several
of the poems are said to have been imitated.</p>

<p>Great as was his success in literature, it was not enough
provision for his daily needs, notwithstanding the help of his
professorship; and Melendez accordingly applied for and obtained
an office as a local judge at Zaragoza, of which he
took possession in September 1789. The duties of this
office were too onerous to admit of much study; but he was
soon removed, in 1791, to the chancery of Valladolid, where
he had more leisure, and where he remained till 1797, when
he was appointed Fiscal of the Supreme Court at Madrid.
During this time he wrote apparently little; but he prepared,
and in 1797 published, another edition of his works with
two additional volumes, enriched with many new poems, in
which he “had elevated his genius to the height of his age;”&mdash;“descriptive
passages of a superior order, elegies powerful
and pathetic, odes grand and elevated, philosophic and moral
discourses and epistles, in which he took alternately the
tone of Pindar, of Homer, of Thomson, and of Pope, and
drew from the Spanish lyre accents she had not previously
learned.”</p>

<p>But notwithstanding the great merit of many of these
poems, the biographer of Melendez had it to confess that
this publication was not so favourably received as the first
had been; and attempts to account for it partly by the circumstances
of the times, and partly by what was new not being
on the whole so finished and well-sustained in interest as his
former poems. Some of them also met with decided disfavour;
especially one, ‘The Fall of Lucifer,’ which showed
that his genius was not of the severer cast calculated for
graver and higher subjects allied to the epic, any more than
to the dramatic. But the merits of Melendez in his own
sphere are too great, and his fame is too well-founded to lo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>se by
acknowledgements which must be made in truth and justice.
It is not improbable that he had been urged by his admirers
to these attempts, to which his own inclinations would not
have led him, and it might thus have been the easiness of
his disposition that made him yield to suggestions which
ended in failure.</p>

<p>In the prologue which he affixed to this edition, Melendez
attempted to prove that poetic studies derogated nothing
from the judicial dignity, and that they had no incompatibility
with the duties and talents of a public man or man of
business. But without following him or his biographer into
such a discussion, we may concede the point so far, that any
one undertaking responsible duties from the State, is bound
to give them his best and undivided energies. If, however,
he has any hours of leisure free from those responsibilities, it
is surely only an extension of his duty for him to employ
them in attempting to make his fellow-men wiser and better,
or happier, in the manner most congenial to his disposition
or talents. Melendez certainly had no need to exculpate
himself in this respect, having been “long remembered at
Zaragoza and Valladolid as a model of integrity and application,
for his zeal in arranging amicably all disputations in
his power, for his affability and frankness in listening to
complaints, and for the humane and compassionate interest
with which he visited the prisoners, accelerating their causes,
and affording them assistance, with an inseparable adhesion to
justice.” <a href="#note14" title="See note">It was for his detractors</a>,&mdash;and Melendez had them,
notwithstanding the amiability of his character and the superiority
of his talents,&mdash;to make these objections, if they could
have done so. His resorting to such apologies only gave
the appearance of a consciousness of weakness, which was not
becoming either in the one character or the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Shortly after the publication of this edition, Melendez went
to Madrid to take possession of his new office. The advanced
age of his predecessor in it had for some time prevented his
due attention to its duties, so that Melendez had many arrears
to dispose of in addition to the ordinary services, through all
which he laboured with much assiduity and credit. But they
were the last satisfactory events of his life, which was henceforth
to be passed in reverses and misery. Yet at that time
he seemed to be in the height of prosperity. Holding an
elevated post under the government, of which his friend
Jovellanos was a member, and respected both at home and
abroad as one of the first literary characters of the age, he
might have justly hoped to be free from any of the darker
misfortunes of life. This exemption, however, was not to be
his lot, serving under a despotic government, of which the
head, Charles IV., was one of the weakest-minded of mortals,
guided by a favourite such as Godoy. When Jovellanos fell
under this favourite’s resentment, to make the blow inflicted
on that illustrious individual more poignant, it was extended
to others, whose only fault was that they shared his esteem.
Melendez was ordered away from Madrid within twenty-four
hours, though his friends procured for him soon after a commission
from the government as inspector of barracks at Medina
del Campo, where he gave himself up again to study and
such duties as were assigned him. Beyond these, however,
he particularly exerted himself, it is recorded, in attending to
the sick at the hospitals, providing that they should not be
sent out into the world, as had often been previously the
case, imperfectly cured or clothed, and unable to effect their
livelihood.</p>

<p>In this hum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>ble occupation he might have been supposed
exempt at least from further malignity, but unfortunately
some sycophant of power thought it would be pleasing to the
favourite to have a frivolous accusation forwarded against
him, which had the effect of his being sent on half salary to
Zamora. There he was fortunate enough to have the intrigues
against him made known, and in June 1802, he received
a royal order to have his full salary allowed, with
liberty to reside where he pleased. He would have preferred
Madrid, but he found it most prudent to return to Salamanca,
and there, arranging his house and library, began to enjoy a
more peaceful life than what he had passed since he left the
University.</p>

<p>The literary world might now have hoped for further efforts
of genius in this asylum, and perhaps some superior work
worthy of his talents and fame; but his spirits had been
broken down by adversity and injustice, and his attention
was distracted by hopes and fears, from which he could never
free himself. A poem on Creation, and a translation of the
Æneid, were the fruits of six years’ retirement from the world;
and he proposed another edition of his works, which however
he did not accomplish, on the rapid succession of events
which again called him forth to a short period of active life,
and subsequent years of suffering.</p>

<p>The revolution of Aranjuez brought Melendez to Madrid,
in the hopes of recovering his former employments; but in
the troubled state of the country, he soon wished to return
to his house, without being able to effect it. The French
had now made themselves masters of the capital, and Melendez
was unfortunately induced to take office under them.
This conduct was contrary, not only to the course taken by
Jovellanos and his other friends, but also to the whole tenor
of his former life and opinions. His easy temper, which had
at all times led him submissive to the wishes of those who
had his confidence, no doubt on this occasion had been infl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>uenced
by persons near him, and he might have thought it
a hopeless struggle to contend with Napoleon.</p>

<p>Having however engaged in this unpatriotic service, he
was sent as a commissioner, on the part of the intrusive government,
to the Asturias, where the people had already risen
in vindication of the national independence. Melendez and
his colleague were seized by the populace, notwithstanding
the efforts of the local authorities, who had placed them for
security in the prison, the doors of which were forced, and
they were led out to be put to death. All entreaties were in
vain. Melendez protested his attachment to the national
cause, and even began reciting some patriotic verses he had
been writing, but the excited multitude would not hear him.
They added insults to menaces, and as a great favour only
permitted them to confess before they should be executed.
Thus a little time was gained; but this was at length concluded
and they were tied to a tree, and the party prepared
to shoot them, when a dispute arose whether they should be
shot from in front or behind as traitors, a piece of etiquette
in such cases considered of importance. The latter counsel
prevailed, and the prisoners had to be loosened and tied
again accordingly, when the authorities and religious orders
of the place, with a particular Cross famous among them, appeared
approaching for their rescue. The people hereon became
calmed, and Melendez and his colleague were taken
back to the prison, whence they were soon permitted to return
to Madrid.</p>

<p>On the success of the Spanish army at Bailen, the French
retired from the capital, and Melendez remained at Madrid,
hoping, through the influence of Jovellanos, to be taken into
favour with the constitutional party. But fortune again
seemed to side with the French, and they returned to Madrid,
when Melendez was again induced to join them, and accep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>ted
office as Councillor of State and President of a Board
of Public Instruction. Thus he inevitably compromised himself
in a cause which was not that of his heart or principles,
and whose apparently irresistible strength could only have
excused his adhesion to it. This supposition, however, also
proved erroneous; and when the French armies had to abandon
Spain, Melendez, with their other principal adherents,
had to fly with them also, having had the further misfortune
to have his house plundered, and his valuable library destroyed,
by the very marauders for whose sake he had lost all his hopes
of the future at home.</p>

<p>Before entering France, Melendez, kneeling down, kissed
the Spanish soil, saying, “I shall not return to tread thee
again.” His apprehensions, notwithstanding his anxiety to
do so, proved correct. He passed four years in France, residing
at Toulouse, Montpelier, Nismes and Alaix, as circumstances
compelled him, in great privation and with bodily
sufferings, the more aggravating, in his advanced age, the
bitter remembrances of the past. A paralytic affection first
incapacitated him from all exertion, and finally, an apoplectic
attack terminated his existence, at Montpelier, on the 24th
May, 1817, in the arms of his wife, who had followed him
through all the vicissitudes of life, and surrounded by the
companions of his exile. A monument was afterwards placed
to his memory in the cemetery by <a href="#note15" title="See note">the Duke de Frias</a>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the indecision of his character in public
life, Melendez was in private remarkable for laborious application
to his studies and duties. His reading was immense,
and his desire unceasing to be useful, and to contribute, by
all the means in his power, to the well-being of his fellows.
His kindness of heart is conspicuous in all his writings, which
also portray the diffidence of his own powers, ascribed to him
by his biographer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>His principal objects of veneration seem to have been the
writings of Newton and Locke. The former, as the “Great
Newton,” is often named by him. Pope he took for his model
avowedly in poetry, and he strove to imitate the moral and
philosophic tone of that great poet’s writings, whose elegance
of style he certainly rivalled. Nothing in Spanish verse had
been ever produced to equal the sweetness of his verses, their
easy tone, and sparkling thoughts and expression. He was
much attached to drawing, but had no inclination for music,
not even to the charms of song, the more singular in one
whose ear for the melody of verse appears to have been so
sensitive. To the very last he seems to have been endeavouring
to improve his poems, which have been thus observed to
have often lost in strength and expression what they gained
in cadence.</p>

<p>“The principles of his philosophy were benevolence and
toleration; and he belonged to that race of philanthropists
who hope for the progressive amelioration of the human race,
and the advent of a period, when civilization, or the empire of
the understanding, extended over the earth, will give men
that grade of perfection and felicity compatible with the
faculties and the existence of each individual. Such are the
manifestations of his philosophic poems, and such a state he
endeavoured to aid in producing by his talents and labours.”</p>

<p>His influence as a poet has certainly been very great. All
the writers in Spain, who immediately succeeded him, especially
Quintana, showed evident proofs of having profited by
the lessons his example gave them, and those lessons seem to
have sunk deeply into the minds of successive generations, so
as to leave no doubt of their continuing in the same course.</p>

<p>After his arrival in France, Melendez wrote a few short
poems, which, notwithstanding his age and failing health,
showed his spirit was still the same, and his imaginati<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>on as
lively as ever. At Nismes he prepared an edition of his
works, which the Spanish government published at their cost
after his death, when they also gave his widow the pension
allotted for her, as according to her husband’s former rank.
This edition has been the one subsequently several times reprinted,
with a biography by the eminent Quintana, worthy
of himself and of his master. The prologue to it, by Melendez,
is very interesting, and from it we learn, with regret,
that upon the destruction of his library, “the most choice
and varied he had ever seen belonging to a private individual,
in the formation of which he had expended a great part of his
patrimony and all his literary life,” he had lost what he considered
some of his best poems, and some tracts, in prose,
which he had prepared for the press, on Legislation, on Civil
Economy, the Criminal Laws, on Prisons, Mendicancy and
other subjects.</p>

<p>The misfortunes of Melendez were certainly much to be
lamented, but throughout them he could unquestionably console
himself with the conviction of having been actuated ever
by upright motives, and of leaving to his country an imperishable
name. His literary career had been an eminently
successful one, and he had felt the full enjoyment of fame.
In the prologue, above mentioned, he refers very feelingly to
the reverses to which he had been subjected, but also with
apparent satisfaction to the various editions and notices of
his works, published both in Spain and abroad.</p>

<p>In leaving revised his works, published afterwards by the
government, Madrid 1820, Melendez left also this positive
direction: “Although I have composed many other poems,
these appear to me the least imperfect, and I therefore forbid
the others to be reprinted under any pretext. I earnestly
request this of the editor, and expect it of his probity and
good feeling, that he will fulfil this, my will, in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> respect.”
In accordance with this request, many of his earlier
works have been, with much propriety, omitted, and the remainder
have been considerably corrected; at the same time
that a great number of poems are added, that had not been
previously published. The <a href="#note16" title="See note">best edition of his works is that
by Salva</a>, Paris 1832.</p>

<p>Melendez enjoyed in his day a higher reputation than
readers at present are willing to concede him, comparing him
with the other poets that have since appeared in Spain. But
the merits of writers should be considered, in justice, relatively
only to those who have preceded them, and by this
standard he is certainly fully entitled to the eulogiums which
his contemporaries awarded him.</p>

<span class="smaller">LEANDRO FERNANDEZ MORATIN.</span></h3>

<p>Spanish writers have in general too much overrated the
<a href="#note20" title="See note">merits of their national dramas</a>, and foreigners have too often
repeated the eulogies, as if they were deserved. Like those
of antiquity, the Spanish, though they abound in passages of
much poetry and feeling, are almost entirely deficient in that
delineation of individual character, which constitutes the
highest class of the art. Thus all the representations may
be observed of the same description of personages and incidents,
given often with much ingenuity, but also often in the
worst taste, and always betokening a limited power of invention.
Of this school Calderon de la Barca was the great
type, both as regards his merits and defects. Lopez de Vega
too, though his comedies are more representations of manners
and every-day life than Calderon’s, only showed his capability
of something better, if he had allowed his genius to seek a
reputation for perfectness, rather than for fecundity. The inferior
order of writers mistook the errors of these for excellences,
and thus exaggerated them.</p>

<p>There were not, however, wanting in Spain persons of
better judgement, who observed those errors with a view to
correct them, and among whom the prominent place is due to
the two Moratins, father and son. Of these the former seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>s
to have been the first of his countrymen who openly denounced
the wrong tendencies of the national dramatists;
and the latter, following in the same track, may be pronounced
the great reformer of the Spanish stage, to whom it
owes some of its best productions.</p>

<p>The elder Moratin was one of the ablest writers of verses
in Spain during the last century, before the new æra of
poetry arose, and his merits, if not of themselves superior to
those of his contemporaries, have had an advantage over
them, in connexion with the reputation of the son, who has
rendered them more celebrated by a pleasing memoir of his
father, prefixed to his works. From this we learn, that if
the father did not attain a high rank himself as a poet or
dramatist, yet he well deserves to be remembered as a bold
and judicious critic, who, both by precept and example,
effected much good in his own day, and still more by instilling
good lessons into the mind of the son, so as to enable
him to attain his merited success.</p>

<p>In the words of this memoir, “Calderon at that time enjoyed
so high a reputation, that it appeared a sacrilegious
hardihood to notice defects in his comedies or sacramental
pieces, which, repeated annually on the stage with every possible
pomp and appliance, delighted the vulgar of all classes,
and perpetuated the applauses of their famous author. Moratin
published three Discourses, which he entitled, ‘Exposition
of the Misconceptions of the Spanish Theatre,’ written
with the good judgement of a man of taste, and with the zeal
of a citizen interested in the progression and literary glory of
his country. In the first he showed the defects in which the
old plays abounded; as also the modern, with which poets,
without rule or plan, supplied the players, sanctioning every
time more irregularity and ignorance. In the two following,
he proved that the Autos of Calderon, so admired by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
multitude, ought not to be suffered in a country that prided
itself as civilized. It is unnecessary to say what opposition
these discourses encountered; it is enough to add, that the
third was scarcely published when the government prohibited
the repetition of what he had condemned:&mdash;a memorable
epoch in the annals of the Spanish stage, which can never remember,
without praise, that judicious and intrepid writer to
whom it owed so useful a reform.”</p>

<p>Of this able critic, Leandro Moratin was the only son that
survived childhood. He was born at Madrid, the 10th of
March, 1760, and in his earliest years is described as having
been remarkable for infantile grace and vivacity. At four
years of age, however, he unfortunately had a severe attack of
the smallpox, which not only left its disfiguring marks on his
countenance, but also seemed to have changed his character,
making him the rest of his life shy and reserved. As he
grew up he shunned all playfellows; like Demophilus, he
was a man among boys,&mdash;Κεῖνος γὰρ ἐν παισὶν νέος&mdash;and
devoting himself to drawing and making juvenile verses, pursued
his favourite studies in secret, so that even the father
seemed not to have been ever fully aware of the bent of his
son’s genius.</p>

<p>The elder Moratin, whose father had been jewel-keeper to
Isabel Farnesi, widow of Philip V., had been brought up to
the profession of the law, in which he had not acquired any
eminence, though he had some as an author. Seeing his
son’s talent for drawing, he had first intended him to take
advantage of it as an artist, but finally placed him with a
brother, Miguel de Moratin, who was a jeweller, to learn his
occupation. In his earlier years the younger Moratin had
been only at an obscure private school in Madrid, but he had
good examples and lessons at home, and recourse to his
father’s library, where he found all the best works in Spani<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>sh
literature, for secret study, beyond the tasks set in routine for
his education. In 1779 the Spanish Academy, in the course
of its objects for the promotion of literary pursuits, had
offered, as a subject for a prize poem, The Taking of Granada;
when the Accessit was awarded to a competitor who had signed
himself Efren de Lardnoz y Morante. On this person being
called for, Leandro Moratin, to the surprise of his father,
presented himself as the author, producing the rough copy of
the verses he had sent. This was naturally a source of great
delight to the father, who might thus foresee, in hope at
least, his son’s future success. But he did not live to witness
it, having died the following year, at only forty-two years of
age, leaving a widow dependent on his son’s labours as a
working jeweller. At this business he continued, therefore,
combining however with it his former studies, as far as his
leisure permitted him.</p>

<p>In 1782 he obtained the honour of another Accessit from
the Academy for a Satire on the vicious practices introduced
into the Spanish language, and a greater feeling thereupon
arose in his favour from literary persons who remembered his
father, with the respect due to his merits. Hence, also,
Leandro Moratin, notwithstanding his natural reserve, was
drawn from his retirement into the company of several young
men of kindred tastes and pursuits, whose conversation and
society had great and good effect on his mind and future
efforts.</p>

<p>In 1785 he published an edition of his father’s poems,
with reflections, which may be considered his first essay on
criticism and declaration of opinion on matters of taste, according
to the precepts of the purest classicism, then so much
in fashion. From his earliest years he had been much attached
to the theatre, then sunk to the low state which he so
feelingly describes in the preliminary discourse to his Comed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>ies,
subsequently published; and having witnessed his father’s
anxiety to reform its abuses, he felt it a sort of inheritance
left him to attempt the task. He had already begun one of
his plays, which however he had not sufficient leisure to complete,
on account of the demands for his daily labour; but
about this time his mother died, and Leandro had then only
his own wants to consider.</p>

<p>At the same time the good and great Jovellanos, whose
notice he had attracted, proposed him as secretary to the
Conde de Cabarrus, then going to Paris on a special mission,
where accordingly Leandro went with that able and enlightened
statesman, in January 1787, returning to Madrid in the
January following. Shortly after the Conde and Jovellanos
fell into ill-favour at court, and all their friends were involved
in their fall. Moratin took shelter in the obscurity of his
original occupation, and so escaped notice. He completed
his play, but could not get it represented, and in the course
of delays had the license for it withdrawn. He wished to be
exempt from labour for maintenance, to give himself up to
his favourite studies, but sought in vain for other means of
attaining this end than from the favour of the government.
A change in the ministry having now occurred, he wrote a
petition, in verse, to the Conde de Florida Blanca, in which,
humorously depicting his wants, he asked a small benefice
in the church. This, though a very small one, was granted
him, and thereupon he had to take the first orders of the
tonsure. Shortly afterwards, Godoy, Prince of the Peace,
came into power, and became a still more effectual patron for
Moratin, on whom he conferred other benefices and favours,
to the amount of about £600 a year sterling, so that he became
at once, for his position in life, wealthy, and enabled to
devote himself entirely to literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been the fashion lately for all parties to decry Godoy,
and there can be no doubt that he was guilty of much misconduct
in the exercise of power. But he was in this only
acting according to the circumstances in which he was placed,
and the favourite and minister of a weak-minded and despotic
monarch could not be expected to have acted much otherwise
than he did. In the memoirs he published in his later years
in his justification, Godoy has, in a tone of apparent sincerity
and earnestness, sometimes amounting even to eloquence,
shown that often he could not have acted otherwise, and that
his faults were the faults of his position, while his merits
were his own. He declares that he was the first minister in
Spain who curbed the power of the Inquisition, and that he
had never instituted any prosecution for private opinions.
His treatment of Jovellanos he might well excuse to himself,
as a return for hostility manifested to him under circumstances
that he might consider to warrant it. But of other
eminent men of learning and of the arts he was the munificent
patron, of Melendez among others, and of Moratin more
especially. The former dedicated to him the second edition
of his works, and Moratin now one of his plays, which had
been received with much favour. From this dedication, a
judgement may be formed by the translation, of the spirit of
Moratin, that, while under the sense of great obligations, he
did not condescend, like other poets, to flatter his Mæcenas’s
vanity by ascriptions of descent from ancient kings or other
fictions; but dwelt only on his personal qualities, and the
great power which he undoubtedly possessed, as exercised
in his favour. The same spirit Moratin showed in his letter
to Jovellanos, in which adulation could less be imputed
to him, as that illustrious individual was in disgrace at court,
and no longer the dispenser of the favours of the gover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>nment.</p>

<p>But Moratin showed the independence of his character still
more decidedly, in refusing the request made by Godoy that
he should write eulogistic verses on a lady of the court; and
it is to the honour of Godoy, we are informed, that though
he was at first angry at the refusal, he passed it over without
subsequent notice.</p>

<p>To another request made by Godoy, for an ode on the
Battle of Trafalgar, Moratin acceded, though it is stated with
considerable disinclination to the task. He could not, he replied
at first, celebrate a lost battle, and as Hermosillia tells
us, could not hide from himself the ridiculousness of having
to represent a complete defeat as a glorious triumph, though
the “dreaded Nelson” had fallen in it. He felt bound, however,
to obey the favourite and to reconcile his task to justice,
wrote his ‘Shade of Nelson,’ in imitation of the Prophecy of
Nereus, and of the Tagus by Fray Luis de Leon. In this
poem, he represents Nelson appearing the same night on the
heights of Trafalgar, and foretelling England’s approaching
ruin, notwithstanding the victory which had been gained “so
dearly, as to be in reality a discomfiture.” He observes, that
“Napoleon, having overcome the Austrians, would now turn
all his energies to the conquest of England, while Spain
would raise a mightier fleet to join him. He therefore counselled
his countrymen to abandon their ambitious projects
and make peace, and to create disunion in foreign countries
by corrupting their cabinets, for the purpose of maintaining
their preponderance.” The thoughts are expressed in elegant
poetical language, but the whole argument shows how little
feeling he had in favour of the subject. In the last edition
of his works prepared for publication before his death, he
took care to have it omitted, but it has been again inserted
in subsequent editions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Prior to this, however, he had had a full opportunity of
judging the character of the English nation. He had obtained
permission to go abroad from Godoy, who also munificently
gave him the means for that purpose. He first went
to Paris, where he had scarcely arrived, in September 1792,
when hearing a great tumult in the streets, and looking out
for the occasion of it, he saw the head of the Princess de
Lamballe borne along by the infuriated multitude on a pike.
Horror-struck at the sight, he immediately left Paris for
London, as, says his biographer, “anxious to contemplate for
the first time true liberty arrayed in popular forms, without
the mortal convulsions of licentiousness, or the withering
foot-marks of oppression.” Here he stayed about a year,
taking notes of the lively impressions made on him of the
“character, ideas, traditions, legislation, and political and
commercial tendency of that singular nation, so worthy of
being studied.” It may be allowed us to regret that those
notes were never published, and perhaps the censor’s license
for them could not have been obtained. The only fruit of his
visit was a translation of Hamlet, which he published in 1798,
on his return.</p>

<p>On leaving England, Moratin passed through Flanders and
some parts of Germany and Switzerland to Italy, whence, after
visiting all the principal cities there, he returned to Spain in
December 1796. Previous to his arrival in Madrid, he had
been appointed Secretary Interpreter of languages, a valuable
appointment in itself, but still more so to him, as it left him
sufficient leisure for study. He took advantage of this to
proceed with several dramas with which he enriched the
Spanish stage, and had projected others which he felt under
the necessity of abandoning. In several of his pieces, and
especially in the Mogigata, which Maury translates La Femelle
Tartuffe, he had offended the clerical party, so that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
was denounced to the Inquisition, and though preserved from
their power under the protection of Godoy, he was subjected
to many and great annoyances. In consequence of these, he
determined to give up further writing for the stage, contenting
himself with producing afterwards only some translations
from the French, and with preparing his most valuable work,
‘On the Spanish Theatre.’ This work treats the subject historically,
and abounds with much interesting information as
well as sound criticisms. On it he passed the latter years of
his life, so that it was not published until after his death.</p>

<p>Shortly after his return from Italy he was named one of a
commission to reform the stage, and on this proving insufficient
for the purposes intended, he was appointed Director of
Theatres by royal order. No one, it might be thought, could
be better adapted for this office, and it would have seemed
one agreeable to his inclinations; but he declined it, preferring
to effect the reforms he recommended by example rather than
by exercise of authority.</p>

<p>The events of the 19th March, 1808, deprived Godoy of
his power, and the French armies soon after entered Madrid.
Moratin had remained at his post in the execution of the
duties of his office, and became involved in the course of proceedings,
the final character of which he could not foresee.
He was set down as one of the French party, and so exposed
to public obloquy, that when the French had to evacuate
Madrid, he felt himself under the necessity of going with
them. When they returned he returned with them, and was
appointed, by Joseph Buonaparte, Chief of the Royal Library,
an appointment which was most congenial to his taste, and
which would have been exceedingly appropriate for him to
accept, had it been only from the national government.</p>

<p>As it was, he had to fly from Madrid a second time wit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>h
the intruders, and henceforth there was nothing for him in
life but privations to endure. Some houses which he had
bought had been seized, and one of them sold. Another,
which was restored to him, had been much injured, and his
books and property destroyed. His benefices were denied
him; a merchant, with whom he had entrusted his money,
became bankrupt; and a dependent, in whom he had confided,
by his defalcation brought a further heavy loss on his means.
He had at first retired to France, but having been excepted
from the list of the proscribed by Ferdinand VII., he returned
to Spain, and for a length of time resided at Barcelona. But
the Inquisition was attempting to rise again into power, and
Moratin, naturally of a timid disposition, felt himself marked
out for a victim. He could not submit to live subject to be
watched and kept in constant alarm; and even when this
office was finally put down, he felt the frequent recurrence of
public commotions more agitating than he could endure. He
therefore determined again to retire to France, first to Bayonne,
in 1823, and afterwards to Bordeaux, to live with a
friend, named Silvela, who had a seminary at that place, and
in whose society he felt sure of enjoying domestic happiness.</p>

<p>Through his whole life, Moratin seems to have required
the aid of friends on whom to rely for daily needs and attentions;
and it was fortunate for him, in his advanced age and
under the pressure of infirmities, to possess such a resting-place
as in Silvela’s establishment. Shortly after this friend
removed to Paris, where also Moratin followed him, and there
he died, the 21st June, 1828. He was buried in the cemetery
of Père la Chaise, in one of the lines to the right of the
chapel, between the remains of Molière and Lafontaine, where
a simple monument, with a cinerary urn, marks his grave.</p>

<p><a href="#note21" title="See note">“There,” says his biographer</a>, “in a foreign land, lies a celebrated
Spaniard, to whom his country did not offer sufficient
security to allow him to die tranquilly in her bosom. A man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
averse to all party feeling, obedient to existing authority, whether
of fact or of right, absorbed in his studies, teacher from
his retirement of the purest morality, incapable of injuring
any one, or of exciting disorder even indirectly, he had to
wander forth many years, not proscribed, but driven away by
apprehensions too justly entertained.”</p>

<p>After his death there were several editions of his works
published, both in France and Spain: the last one in the collection
of Spanish authors by Rivadeneyra, Madrid 1848, as
the last seems most correct and complete. This republication
is more interesting, as also containing, in the same volume,
the works of his father, Nicolas Moratin. It is to be regretted
that other works of his, yet existing in manuscript,
have not been added, especially the account of his travels.</p>

<p>Moratin was an exceedingly careful writer, and very fastidious
in the correction of his verses. His admirers, especially
those of the classic school, have praised him as a great lyric
poet, even superior to Melendez. This, however, he felt was
not just; and without derogating from his merits, we must
pronounce him far inferior to that eminent poet, whose works
surpassed all that had preceded him in Spanish poetry. The
fame of Moratin must rest on his plays, into which, however,
it is not the object of this work to enter, confined as it is to
lyric poetry. They are only five in number, and, like Sheridan’s,
are remarkable for neatness and elegance of dialogue,
as much as for incident and character. The Spanish theatre
owes all its subsequent merit to Moratin; he reformed the
taste of the times by giving the stage better works than it
had previously possessed, and assuredly was thus one of the
greatest public benefactors of his age.</p>

<p>In the history of the literature of every country, it is interesting
to observe with what noiseless steps true genius generally
proceeds to win popular favour, compared with the means to
which mediocrity resorts for whatever share of notice it can
attain. There are some writers who, with great talent, have
some counterbalancing deficiency, respecting whose merits
more discussion will be consequently excited, than respecting
the superior qualities of others, not liable to the same observations.
To obtain that kind of notoriety, it is often requisite
to belong to some school or party, whose praise will give a
temporary importance to works written, according to their
taste or system, while those out of their pale will be passed
over with at best only cold commendations. In Spain, as elsewhere,
poetry has had its classical and romantic schools, and
the merits of all writers, belonging to one or the other of
them, were fully set forth by their respective partisans; while,
if there happened to be one who could not be claimed by
either, like Arriaza, he was allowed to pass comparatively
unnoticed by the critics of the day.</p>

<p>Of this very pleasing author no detailed biography has
been published; and his claims to be considered one of the
first modern poets of Spain seem to be scarcely recogn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>ized by
his countrymen, who read with surprise the commendations
passed on him abroad. Thus they have allowed seven editions
of his works to be circulated and exhausted, without
satisfying our curiosity by any of those particulars of private
life, with which we love to consider the characters of worth
and genius. All we are informed of him, in the short notices
given of Arriaza by Wolf, Maury and Ochoa, is, that he was
born at Madrid, in the year 1770, where the last-mentioned
writer also says he died, in 1837.</p>

<p>From his name, it would seem that he was of Basque descent,
and his family connections must have been “noble”
and influential, from his career through life, though we have
no account given of them. We learn, however, that he was
educated at the Seminary of Nobles at Madrid, whence he
was afterwards sent a cadet to the Military College at Segovia,
and that he finally entered the navy. In one of his
Epistles, in verse, he informs us that he was engaged in the
expedition to Oran, and thence sailed to Constantinople, of
which he gives a poetical description.</p>

<p>In 1798 he had to quit this service, on account of a disease
of the eyes; and he then published the first edition of his
poems. In 1802 he was appointed Secretary of Legation at
London, and there wrote his principal poem, ‘Emilia,’ which
was published at Madrid in the year following. The subject
was the wish of a lady of fortune to bring up orphan children
and others to the study of the fine arts; and it contains
many fine passages, but was left unfinished.</p>

<p>In 1805 he went to Paris, where also he resided some time.
On his return to Spain, he took part in the struggles against
the French, having entered the ranks as a soldier, and having
by his verses also vehemently instigated his countrymen to
rise against the invaders. Of all the poets of the day,
he seems to have been the most prolific in those patriotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
effusions, which, no doubt, agreeing so well with the national
temperament, had no small effect in keeping up the spirit of
the Spanish people throughout the war. When the French
entered Madrid, Arriaza, while engaged in resisting them,
had a brother killed by his side, fighting in the same cause,
to whose memory he has given a tribute of affection accordingly
among his verses.</p>

<p>In the subsequent discussions in Spain respecting the government,
Arriaza took part with those who advocated the
rights of the absolute king. For this advocacy, on the return
of Ferdinand VII. to full power, he received his reward,
having been appointed Knight of the Order of Charles III.,
and Secretary of Decrees, besides receiving several other minor
favours and offices. Henceforth Arriaza seems to have passed
his life at court, in the quiet enjoyment of literary pursuits.
He might be considered the Poet Laureate of Spain, as he
seems to have allowed scarcely any opportunity to pass by
unhonoured, of paying homage to the court in celebration
of birthdays and other such occasions. His works abound
with these loyal effusions, though they might generally have
been better omitted.</p>

<p>It must, however, be said, in justice, that he was evidently
sincere in those principles, to which he adhered under all
circumstances, even when the Constitutionalists were in the
ascendent. Once only he was betrayed into an eulogium of
the other line of opinions, which had an effect rather ludicrous,
so far as he was concerned in it. In 1820, when the
constitution of 1812 had been anew promulgated, a friend of
his, Don Luis de Onis, was appointed minister from Spain to
Naples, and a banquet having been given him on his departure,
Arriaza was induced to write verses on the occasion,
which, full of apparent enthusiasm, abounded in spirit and
beautiful images, beyond his usual facility and fuln<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>ess of expression.
Carried away, no doubt, by the contagion of the
company, he gave way to what, in soberer mood, he would have
thought most dangerous doctrines. He painted the envoy as
going “to Parthenope to announce our revolution;” adding,
“To Parthenope that is now groaning beneath flowery chains,
and to whom, though her syrens celebrate her in songs of
slavery, thou wilt be the Spanish Tyrtæus, and raise them to
the high employ to sing of country and virtue;” praising the
heroism of Riego as to be offered as an example, “to throw
down the holds of oppression.” The Neapolitan government
obtained notice of this composition, and actually used it as
sufficient cause for objecting to receive Don Luis as Spanish
minister, “because he was coming to inculcate revolutionary
principles.” Arriaza heard with horror that he was stigmatized
as a liberal, and was urgent to disclaim such opinions, notwithstanding
what he had written. Don Luis meanwhile
was detained at Rome, until, by a strange coincidence, the
revolution broke out at Naples also, and he entered the city
almost as in fulfilment of the prophecy, that he was to be the
harbinger of it.</p>

<p>The best edition of Arriaza’s works is that of 1829, printed
at the Royal Press of Madrid, of which the one of Paris, 1834,
is a reprint. They consist of almost all varieties of song, and
are almost all equally charming. His satirical pieces even
are light and pleasing, as well as his anacreontic and erotic
effusions, while his patriotic songs and odes breathe a spirit
well suited to the subjects.</p>

<p>Maury, who has made him better known abroad by his
praises than others, his contemporaries, seems to have regarded
him with especial favour. He says of him:&mdash;“Depuis Lope de
Vega, M. d’Arriaza est le seul de nos poëtes qui nous semble
penser en vers. La nature le fit poëte, les évènements l’ont
fait auteur. Il était arrivé à sa réputation littéraire sans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> y
prétendre, il l’accrue pour ainsi dire à son corps défendant.”
In truth he seems to have poured forth his verses without effort,
as a bird does its song, with a simplicity and truthfulness
which went to the heart of the hearer, and left in it a sensation
of their being only the echoes of its own. As Maury has well
observed, “parlent à la raison et à l’esprit, comme au cœur
et à l’imagination, elles offrent en même temps aux amateurs
de la langue Castillane les sons harmonieux et les tournures
piquantes qui la distinguent avec une grande élégance de
diction et une clarté rare chez la plupart de nos écrivains.”</p>

<p>It is true that his style is exceedingly easy, and the expression
generally very clear, but it must also be acknowledged,
on the part of the translator, that obscurities are
frequently to be found in his lines, when he must discover a
meaning for himself. It was Arriaza’s own doctrine in the
prologue to his works, “that there can be no true expression
of ideas where there does not reign the utmost clearness of
diction; that what the reader does not conceive at the first
simple reading, cannot make in his imagination the prompt
effect required, and much less move his heart in any way.
This clearness,” he observes, “should also be associated with a
constant elegance of expression; though he does not consider
this elegance to consist in a succession of grammatical inversions,
or revolving adjectives, or metaphor on metaphor,
but the mode most select and noble of saying things becomingly
to the style in which they are written.”</p>

<p>Arriaza was eminently what the French call a <i lang="fr">poëte de
société</i>; and thus his verses were favourites with the higher
classes particularly. He abjured the practices of the Romanticists
who affected to despise the shackles of metre, as if the
melody of verse, being merely mechanism, were of inferior
consideration. On the contrary, he intimates that he considers
it of primary importance, as if “whether a statue should <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>be
made of wax or marble.” Thus he made cadence a principal
study, and his verses becoming thereby better adapted for
music, obtained greater vogue in the higher circles by means
of accompaniments. Some even seem to have been expressly
written for that purpose; for instance, among other pieces of
a domestic character, one, a very pleasing Recitative, in which
his wife and daughter join him in thanksgiving for his recovery
from a dangerous illness. Though generally far from
being impassioned, some of his verses are full of tender feeling,
as the ‘Young Sailor’s Farewell.’ This may be pronounced
the most popular piece of modern poetry in Spain,
being most in the memories of those whom he himself calls
“the natural judges in these matters, the youth of both
sexes, in whose lively imagination and sensible hearts may
find better acceptation, the only two gifts with which I may
rejoice to have endowed my verses, naturalness and harmony.”</p>

<p>Arriaza must have acquired in his youth the rudiments of
a sound education, and he was distinguished in later life for
a knowledge of the French, Italian and English languages.
Still he was not considered by his contemporaries as a person
of extensive reading; and thus we do not find in his works
any allusions or illustrations of a classical character, though
it is almost ludicrous to observe with what pertinacity he
introduces the personages of the heathen mythology, on all
occasions where he can do so. Some of his ideas also run
into the ridiculous, as in one of his best pieces, ‘La Profecia
del Pirineo,’ he says, that on the heroic defenders of Zaragoza
“there were at once on their faithful brows raining bombs
and laurels.”</p>

<p>The Ode to Trafalgar, notwithstanding its being liable to
the observation above made, of too frequent invocations of
the Muses, is an admirable exemplification of an appropri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>ate
poem on such a subject. This battle, no doubt on account
of its decisive effect, has been more celebrated than others.
But it must be acknowledged to have been an unequal fight
between the British and the Spanish portion of the allied
fleet, as the former were in a high state of discipline, and the
latter were newly levied and hurried out of port, before the
officers and men had become sufficiently acquainted with one
another to take their respective parts, with the precision
necessary for such an occasion. Yet it is well known that
the Spaniards fought with desperate and unswerving courage
throughout, and their poets were therefore well warranted in
taking the subject, as one doing honour to the national
bravery.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the battle have lately again come
into discussion in Spain, with naturally considerable warmth,
on M. Thiers, in his History of the Consulate and the Empire,
having been guilty of the extraordinary error to allege
that the Spanish fleet fled, the greater part of them, from
the battle, when, in fact, it was only the division of the
French Admiral Dumanoir that had done so. This he did
“for the purpose of preserving a naval division for France,”
as Dumanoir himself afterwards stated, in his justification,
though he was disappointed in that patriotic wish, having
been met a few days after by Sir Robert Calder’s squadron,
when all his four ships were taken in a less renowned combat.</p>

<p>The translation of the Ode has been made as nearly into
the same metre with the original, as the forms of verse used
in the two languages would admit. That of the ‘Farewell’
may be considered in the same light also, though the original
has the first and fourth lines rhyming together, and the second
with the third. This is an old and common form in Spanish
poetry, and agrees well with our alternate lines of eight and
six syllables, which Johnson considered “the most soft an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>d
pleasing of our lyric measures.” In the Ode, it is interesting
to observe not only the manly style of sentiment throughout,
but also the absence of any ungenerous feeling against the
English. Arriaza had, however, both as a seaman and a diplomatist,
while resident in England, had sufficient opportunities
of learning to think more justly of the English character
than some other writers of the Continent.</p>

<p>Beyond his poems, Arriaza wrote several political pamphlets.
The first was published at Seville in 1809, after the
battle of Talavera, when the English, notwithstanding the
victory, had to retreat into Portugal, giving occasion to the
French party in Spain to allege that they were about to
abandon the country to the French, and keep possession of
the principal ports. In this pamphlet, which he entitled the
‘Pharos of Public Opinion,’ Arriaza combated these suspicions,
and by a strenuous assertion of the good faith of the
English, succeeded in disabusing the minds of his countrymen
of what he termed “such malignant insinuations.”</p>

<p>The second pamphlet he termed ‘Virtue of Necessity,’
shortly after the disastrous battle of Ocania; and its object
was to stimulate the English government and nation to give
more assistance than they had yet done, by money and otherwise.
He proposed in return to give the English free right
of commerce with the Spanish colonies in America, at least
for a stated period, observing that they already had extensive
dealings with them by contraband, and that the free commerce
would make the English neutral, at least, in the question
of the colonies wishing to declare themselves independent,
while otherwise it would be their interest to have them independent.
This pamphlet especially is full of sound statesmanlike
ideas, and proves how well he was acquainted with
the state of public feeling in England, on the several particulars
respecting which he was writing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>A third pamphlet he wrote in English, and published it in
London in 1810, where he was then sent on the part of the
Spanish government. This he entitled ‘Observations on the
system of war of the Allies in the Peninsula;’ and he endeavoured
in it to urge the English to send more troops to the
Peninsula, at certain points, where he considered they would
be of most avail in disconcerting the plans of the French, and
assisting the Guerrilla warfare the Spaniards were carrying
on. He explained the determined fidelity of the Spaniards
to the cause of their independence, but showed they would
be insufficient to effect it, without the assistance he came to
seek. This pamphlet was favourably received in England,
and was noticed in Parliament; and the author had the good
fortune to hope that his efforts had been successful, as he
says, “The English government then sent greater reinforcements
to their army, which emerging from its inaction,
acquired the superiority preserved until the happy conclusion
of the war.”</p>

<p>For these and other writings, Arriaza received the thanks
of the Regency in the name of the king, and had just cause
to consider that a sufficient counterbalance to the misrepresentations
made of his conduct in France, and elsewhere, by
the opposite party. In a note affixed to the last edition of
his poems, he complains that in a work published in France,
‘Biography of Contemporary Characters,’ there was an article
respecting him “full of errors, even regarding the most public
circumstances of his life,” which he seems to have considered
written from party feeling. If his surmises were correct, it
is the more to be regretted that he did not take the best
means of correcting those misrepresentations, by giving an
authentic biographical account of his career in reply. He might
thus not only have done justice to himself, but also have
satisfied the desires of his admirers, who would naturally have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
felt sufficient interest in his fame to have rejoiced in those
details. Whatever may be the course which a man of genius
takes in public life from honest principles, he may always
rely on finding in literature a neutral harbour where he may
retire in confidence from all turmoils, and expect full justice
awarded to his motives and memory. In the midst of political
contentions, where so much always depends on circumstances
with which we are little acquainted, it is often difficult
at the time to know what is the proper course to follow.
It is enough for us that those we admire have ever been distinguished
for their sincerity and uprightness in the conduct
they pursued.</p>

<p>With regard to Arriaza, our greatest regret must be that,
with his apparently extreme facility of versification, and capability
of elevating his mind to the conception of nobler subjects,
he confined his genius so much to trivial events of the
day, and thus wrote for his contemporaries instead of for
posterity.</p>

<span class="smaller">MANUEL JOSÈ QUINTANA.</span></h3>

<p>Connecting the present age of modern Spanish poetry with
that of the past generation, by a happily protracted existence,
as well as by the style and tone of his writings, the venerable
subject of this memoir still survives, to close a life of active
usefulness in a healthy and honoured old age.</p>

<p>Quintana was born at Madrid, the 11th April, 1772, of
a respectable family of Estremadura. He received his primary
education in classical learning at Cordova, whence he
proceeded to Salamanca, and graduated there in canon and
civil law. In this university he had the advantage of studying
under Melendez Valdes, by whom he was soon favourably
noticed, and was made known to the illustrious Jovellanos,
by whose counsels also he had the good fortune to be assisted.
Thus his natural disposition for the study of elegant literature
was encouraged, both by precept and example, under two
such able directors, to take a higher course than the mere
study of law, for which profession he was destined.</p>

<p>Having been admitted an Advocate of the Supreme Court,
he has held various appointments, as fiscal of the tribunal
of commerce, and censor of theatres; afterwards chief clerk
of the Secretary-General to the Central Junta of Government,
secretary of decrees and interpretation of languages, membe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>r
of the censorship to the Cortes, and of the commission for
the formation of a new plan of education. In the last, he
was charged with the duty of drawing up a report of all the
works on the subject presented to the government, which
was, in 1835, approved of by the Cortes.</p>

<p>In the two former of these employments he was interrupted
by the French invasion, when he took an active part against
the invaders. Receiving afterwards the other offices mentioned,
he wrote many of the proclamations and other addresses which
were put forth on the part of the national government, during
the struggle for independence. Throughout those eventful
times, he was in the most advanced rank of the party that
advocated constitutional rights, so that when Ferdinand VII.
returned to the possession of absolute power, in 1814, he
was, amongst the proscribed, made a prisoner, and confined in
the castle of Pamplona.</p>

<p>There he was kept six years, without being allowed to communicate
with his friends, or make use of his pen. On the
constitutional government becoming re-established, he was
released, and restored to his offices as secretary for the interpretation
of languages, and member of the board of censors.
In 1821, the directorship-general of public education having
been formed, he was made president, until 1823, when the
constitution was again set aside, and he was again deprived
of his employments.</p>

<p>Hereupon Quintana retired to Estremadura to his family,
and lived there till the end of 1828, when he was permitted
to return to Madrid, to continue his labours and literary
studies. The following year he was named member of the
board for the museum of natural sciences, and in 1833 was re-established
in his former employment, as secretary for interpretations
for which his knowledge of the French, English
and other languages rendered him qualified, and also reapp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>ointed
president of the council of public instruction. He
was shortly after appointed preceptor to her present Majesty,
Queen Isabel II., and although ever maintaining strong liberal
principles, has been since, under the administration of
Narvaez, named a senator of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Quintana first appeared as an author in 1795, when he
published a small volume of poems, among which was an Ode
to the Sea, considered one of his best compositions. The
greater part, however, of them were of unequal merit, and
those have been omitted in subsequent editions: the next
one was published in 1802, and it has been reprinted with
additions several times. The best and most complete edition
of his poetical works was published at Madrid, in 1820, in
two volumes, entitled, ‘Poems, including the patriotic odes
and tragedies, the Duke of Viseo, and Pelayo.’ Of this edition
five or six surreptitious reprints have been made at Bordeaux
and elsewhere, the laws regarding copyright having only
lately been made accordant with justice in Spain as regards
authors, though they do not yet extend them protection
against piratical republications from abroad.</p>

<p>The tragedy of the ‘Duke of Viseo,’ imitated from the English,
the ‘Castle Spectre’ of Lewis, was brought forward in
1801, and that of ‘Pelayo’ in 1805. The latter, on a favourite
subject of their ancient history, was received with much
favour by his countrymen, as were also many of his patriotic
odes and poems, written in a spirit accordant with the national
feeling. Most of these were at the time inserted in two
periodical works he had under his direction; the first, ‘Variedades
de Ciencias, Literatura y Artes,’ and the second, the
‘Seminario Patriotico,’ which was of a political character,
and established to promote, and sustain the spirit of independence,
against the French invasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Beyond his original poems, Quintana has done an important
service to Spanish literature by publishing ‘A Collection
of select Spanish Poetry,’ altogether in six volumes,
Madrid, 1830-33, with critical and biographical notices, reprinted
in Paris by Baudry, 1838. These notices are written in
a tone of great impartiality and fairness, and are preceded by
a Dissertation, as an Introduction, on the History of Spanish
Poetry, which, written as it is with eminent ability, Mr.
Wiffen has shown great judgement in translating, prefixed to
his very correct and elegant version of the works of Garcilasso
de la Vega, London, 1823. Besides this valuable collection
of Spanish poetry, Quintana has favoured the public with a
work in three volumes,&mdash;‘Lives of celebrated Spaniards,’ of
which the first volume was published in 1807, the other two
in 1830 and 1833 respectively.</p>

<p>The first volume, which has been translated into English
by Mr. Preston, London, 1823, contains the lives of the
earlier heroes of Spanish history,&mdash;the Cid Campeador,
Guzman the Good, Roger de Lauria, the Prince of Viana,
and Gonzalo de Cordova; all bearing impressions of the enthusiastic
and poetic feelings, characteristic of the comparatively
youthful period of life at which they were written. It
was Quintana’s intention to have proceeded with a series of
like biographies; but the subsequent public events, in which
he had to take so active a part, interrupted the task, and
when he resumed it, after the lapse of twenty years, it was
under the influence of other feelings. He then proceeded
principally with the lives of persons distinguished in American
history; the second volume containing those of Vasco Nunez
de Balboa and Francisco Pizarro; and the third volume those
of Alvaro de Luna, and Bartolome de las Casas. Of these
two volumes, the former has been translated into English by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Mrs. Hobson, Edinburgh, 1832; and of the third a translation
has been announced, London, 1851; both, and the latter
especially, well deserving of study.</p>

<p>In the first volume, treating of heroes, whose history,
almost lost in the obscurity of remote times, might be considered
among the fabulous legends prevailing everywhere in
the first formations of society, it seemed only appropriate to
give a colouring of poetry, to characters of whose actions
nothing could be judged, except by their outward bearing.
But in the others he could write as a philosophic historian,
inquiring into the motives of actions, and teaching lessons of
public morality by individual examples. The life of Alvaro
is thus particularly interesting, depicting the caprices of
fortune, as they affect</p>

<p class="noindent">In the other lives he maintains the high tone of feeling
shown in his beautiful Ode to Balmis, the philanthropic
introducer of vaccination into America, where the ravages of
the disease, so graphically <a href="#note23" title="See note">described by Humboldt</a>, had made
this benefit more peculiarly desirable.</p>

<p>The generous sentiments expressed in this ode are such
as to do honour not only to Quintana, but also to the nation,
where they are in the present generation adopted, as we find
them repeated emphatically by <a href="#note24" title="See note">so popular a writer as Larra</a>.
More than thirty years had elapsed after writing that ode,
when Quintana, in the Life of the enthusiastic Las Casas,
proved his consistency of character and principles, by maintaining
them in a work of historical character, as he had done
in poetry in his youth.</p>

<p>In the prologue to the third volume he says, “The author
will be accused of little regard for the honour of his country,
when he so frankly adopts the sentiments and principles <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>of
the Protector of the Indians, whose imprudent writings have
been the occasion of so much opprobrium, and of subministering
such arms to the detractors of Spanish glories.
But neither the extravagance or fanatical exaggerations of Las
Casas, nor the abuse which the malignity of strangers have
made of them, can erase from deeds their nature and character.
The author has not gone to imbibe them from suspicious
fountains; nor to judge them as he has done, has he
regarded other principles than those of natural equity, or
other feelings than those of his own heart. Documents carefully
appended for this purpose, and the attentive perusal of
Herrera, Oviedo, and others our own writers as impartial and
judicious as those, give the same result in events and opinions.
What then was to be done? To deny the impressions received,
and repel the decision which humanity and justice dictate, on
account of not compromising what is called the honour of
the country? But the honour of a country consists in actions
truly great, noble and virtuous of its inhabitants; not in
gilding with justifications, or insufficient exculpations, those
that unfortunately bear on themselves the seal of being
iniquitous and cruel. To strangers who to depress us, accuse
us of cruelty and barbarity in our discoveries and conquests
of the New World, we might reply with other examples on
their own part, as or more atrocious than ours, and in times
and under circumstances sufficiently less excusable.…</p>

<p>“The great glories and usefulnesses, which result from
extended conquests and dominations, are always bought at a
great price, whether of blood, or violence, or reputation and
fame: unhappy tribute to be paid even by nations the most
civilized, when the impulse of destiny bears them to the same
situation. Glorious, without doubt, was for us the discovery
of the New World! But at what cost was it bought! For
myself what affects me, leaving apart as not required here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the question of the advantages which Europe has derived
from that singular event, I will say, that wherever I find,
whether in the past or the present, aggressors and aggrieved,
oppressors and oppressed, on no account of ulterior utility,
nor even of national consideration, am I able to incline myself
to the former, or to fail in sympathizing with the latter. I
may have put therefore into this historical question more
entireness and candour than is commonly expected, when
referring to our own conduct, but no odious prejudices, nor
an inclination to injure or detract. Let us everywhere give
some place in books to justice, now that unfortunately it is
wont to have so little left it in the affairs of the world.”</p>

<p>Holding such high opinions in all his writings, it may be
seen that the youth of Spain cannot have a better guide to
take for private study than those writings, the best preparatives
for honourable exertion in life; and Quintana’s own
history shows, that whatever misfortunes may befall any one
individually, he does not labour or suffer in vain, who labours
or suffers honestly in a just cause. In another part of the
same prologue, Quintana says of his own lot, “Of this variety
of circumstances and continued alternations, from good to ill,
and from ill to good, not small has been the part fallen to
the author of this work. Drawn by the force of events from
his study and domestic lares, flattered and excessively exalted
now, afterwards borne down and contemned, falling into imprisonment
and proceeded against capitally, destined to a
long and perhaps indefinite detention, deprived during it of
communications and even of his pen, released from it, when
he least hoped, to rise and prosper, and descending again
soon to be endangered, he has experienced all, and nothing
now can be to him new. Let it not be supposed from this
that he puts it forth here as a merit, and less, that he presents
it in complaint. For of whom should I complain? Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
men? These in the midst of my greatest calamities, with
very few exceptions, have shown themselves constantly regardful,
benevolent, and even respectful towards me. Of
fortune? And what pledges had she given me to moderate
for me the rigour with which she treated the rest? Were
they not of as much or more value than I? Political and
moral turbulences are the same as the great physical disorders,
in which the elements becoming excited, no one is
sheltered from their fury.”</p>

<p>Resigning himself thus to his fate, Quintana seems to have
learned the philosophical secret of preserving his equanimity
in all the vicissitudes of life, to the enjoyment of a tranquil
old age. The privilege of attaining this is a favour to every
one, to whom it is granted; but its highest enjoyments must
be consequent only on a life of active usefulness, with a conscience
void of offence. The man of cultivated mind, who
has been called upon to do or to suffer more than others his
fellows in the turmoils of the world, may then be supposed
to receive his greater reward in the remembrances of scenes,
happier perhaps in the retrospect than in the reality, which
may have given them even the semblance of a longer existence.
As perspectives appear lengthened, according to the
number and variety of objects that intervene to the view, so
life itself may appear to have been longer or shorter, according
to the memory and character of events witnessed in its
course. Described as a person of athletic form, yet unbowed
by the burden of fourscore years, Quintana, as before observed,
still survives, to receive the honour justly due to him for his
honourable exertions through life, the remembrances of which
may thus give him more pleasurable enjoyments, than can be
supposed to fall to the lot of ordinary mortals.</p>

<p>As a poet, if a foreigner may be allowed to expr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>ess an opinion,
for which he has no native authority to adduce, Quintana
may be said to be more eloquent than poetical. As
Quintilian said of Lucan, both also natives of Spain, “ut
dicam quod sentio, magis oratoribus quam poetis annumerandus.”
Quintana’s eloquence consists in earnestness more
than in flights of fancy. His favourite subjects were the glories
of his country; and his patriotic odes, in which he endeavoured
to incite his countrymen to imitate the examples of
their forefathers, have been pronounced his best compositions.
He has as a poet paid his tribute of admiration to beauty and
the arts; but his whole soul seems to be poured forth when
pathetically mourning over the dimmed glories of his country,
as when at the thought “of our miserable squadrons flying
before the British,” he turns to the Padillias and Guzmans
of former days, “when the Spaniard was master of half of
Europe, and threw himself upon unknown and immense seas
to give a new world to men.”</p>

<p>As a patriotic poet Quintana has been compared to Beranger,
and is said to have had the same power over the minds
of his countrymen. If the parallel be correct, it may be
curious to consider how characteristically these two poets appeal
to the feelings of their admirers; one by songs and incidents,
which though often trivial, yet speak to the heart in
its most sensitive points, while the other proceeds to the same
object by martial odes of commanding austerity. Besides the
Ode to Balmis, the other one in this work, on the Battle of
Trafalgar, has been chosen for translation, as most likely to
interest the English reader, though it may not be in itself so
much to be admired as some others of his poems. The reader
will perhaps observe a constrained style in it, even beyond
that of translation,&mdash;sentiments forced, as if the subject had
not been taken voluntarily. It must not therefore be looked
upon as a favourable specimen of Quintana’s genius, like the
Ode to Balmis, which more fully shows the character of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
mind.</p>

<p>Quintana, more than other poets of his time, has written in
one style of verse, as in imitation of the Pindaric ode, or of
our Gray and Dryden. Thus with free metres and often
unfettered by rhyme, he has a staid measured tone, well suited
to the subjects he has generally adopted. They are considered
in Spain as of an elegiac character; and as accordant
with them, they have fallen in the translation into the form
of our elegies, or the heroic lines with alternate rhymes, the
style of verse which Dryden, a high authority on such a question,
pronounced “the most magnificent of all the measures
which our language affords.”</p>

<p>Much as Quintana has published, both of his own works
and of the works of others, for the advancement of sound
learning and moral instruction, we have still great cause to
regret that the circumstances of the times in which he has
lived have prevented him from publishing more. Not only
has he been interrupted in the course of those instructive
biographies, of which we have such valuable beginnings, but
we might have hoped, if he had lived in more peaceful times,
that he would have given the world some work, of a character
more distinctively his own, to place his name still higher in
the history of elegant literature. It was one of the maxims
of the wise Jovellanos, “that it was not sufficient for the purposes
of good government to keep the people quiet, but that
they ought to be kept contented.” Without this condition
the other cannot be expected; and for all public commotions,
therefore, the rulers are always most responsible, as unmindful
of this truth. The greatest evil is, when the whole literary
world has thus also further cause to complain of their misdeeds,
as affecting those who were endowed with talents of a
higher order, such as to make all men interested in their
well-being. It is to be hoped that we are now, under <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>the
benignant reign of Isabel the Second, entitled to expect a
more liberal government, and the advent of a still brighter
æra for the literature of Spain.</p>

<p>Taking the space of eighty years, as comprehending the
period during which modern Spanish poetry has been peculiarly
distinguished for superior excellence, we may now make
a further division of this period, into the former and latter
parts of it. All the poets, whose lives we have hitherto traced,
wrote their principal works previously to the year 1810; after
which time we have a succession of writers, whose genius may
perhaps be found to take a yet wider range of thought and
feeling, consequent on the extended field of knowledge, which
later events presented to their observation.</p>

<span class="smaller">FRANCISCO MARTINEZ DE LA ROSA.</span></h3>

<p>Throughout the civilized world, and even beyond it, this
eminent statesman has long been heard of, as one who, while
devoting his life faithfully to promote the welfare of his own
country, had exerted himself no less assiduously for the general
interests of mankind. As an orator, a statesman and a
political writer, he has thus obtained a deservedly high European
reputation, due to his services and merits. In Spain he
is further known as one of the first literary characters of
whom his country has to boast, and as a dramatist and lyric
poet of a very superior order.</p>

<p>Martinez de la Rosa was born the 10th March, 1789, at
Granada, where also he received his education, completing it
at the University in that city. Before the age of twenty he
had gone through the usual course of study in the ancient
and some of the modern languages, in philosophy, mathematics,
canon and civil law, with such success as to have
been enabled to undertake a professorship of philosophy there,
perfecting himself in the art of oratory, in which his natural
talents already had become manifest, as they soon afterwards
gave him the means of greater distinction. From those pursuits
he was called away, in 1808, on the occurrence of the
French invasion, to take an active part in the struggle for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
national independence, into which he entered with youthful
ardour, by public declamations, and by writing in a periodical
instituted to maintain it.</p>

<p>As the French arms advanced victoriously, Martinez de la
Rosa, with others of the party who had been most conspicuous
in their opposition to them, had to take refuge in Cadiz.
He was first employed to proceed to Gibraltar, as his future
colleague, <a href="#note29" title="See note">the Conde de Toreno</a>, had been sent to London, to
obtain a cessation of hostilities, in the war then yet existing
between England and Spain, and concert measures of alliance
against the French. In this mission he had the desired success,
having further obtained from the governor of Gibraltar
arms and ammunition, which enabled the Spanish forces
under Castanios to march and obtain, at Bailen, the memorable
triumph of the 19th July, 1808. In consequence of
this victory, the French had to evacuate Madrid, and the
Central Junta was formed, superseding the first actors in the
conflict. On this, Martinez de la Rosa took advantage of the
circumstances to go to England, and observe there himself,
says his biographer, <a href="#note30" title="See note">the celebrated Pacheco</a>, “in its birth-place,
where it was natural, complete and necessary, that representative
system, which the spirit of reform wished to
bring over for the people of the Continent.” Wolf says he
had there a diplomatic commission, adding, that he took advantage
of it “to familiarize himself with the English constitution,
for which he always had a great predilection.”</p>

<p>Whether he had public duties entrusted to him or not,
Martinez de la Rosa seems then to have stayed some time in
London, studying the workings of the parliamentary system,
the good fruits of which he, as Mirabeau had before him,
found in his legislative career. There he printed, in 1811,
his poem, Zaragoza, written in competition for the prize offered
by the Central Junta, in celebration of the defence of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
city in 1809, and there also he wrote several other poems.
The one of Zaragoza seems not to have been reprinted in
Spain till the publication of his collected poems in Madrid in
1833, and no adjudication ever was made on the compositions
prepared at the suggestion of the Junta, but it is stated that
the judges had unanimously agreed to confer on him the
premium offered in the name of the nation.</p>

<p>In 1811 the French armies had driven the assertors of
national independence from all the other principal parts of
Spain to Cadiz, and there the Cortes were convoked to meet.
There then, Martinez de la Rosa returned, and though not
yet of the age required by law to be chosen a Deputy, he
took part in all the deliberations of the national councils, and
was appointed Secretary to the commission on the freedom of
the press. Meanwhile the siege of Cadiz was commenced by
the French and pressed unremittingly; but the spirit of the
defenders did not fail them. Martinez de la Rosa and Quintana
continued their literary labours, and the former produced
a comedy and a tragedy, both of which were received
with much favour. The latter continues a favourite on the
stage, on a subject well chosen from Spanish history, and entitled
the ‘Widow of Padillia.’ To use his own words, “It
was represented, for the first time, in July 1812, and in days
so unfortunate, that it could not be produced even in the
theatre at Cadiz, on account of the great danger from the
bombs of the enemy, which had nearly caused, a little before,
the destruction of the building, crowded at the time with a
numerous audience. For this reason they had to erect a
theatre of wood in another part of the city, at a distance from
where the French artillery had directed their aim.”</p>

<p>Shortly after this the siege was raised, and the French
having again evacuated Madrid, the Cortes were convoked to
assemble there, when Martinez de la Rosa was elected De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>puty
for his native city. He had throughout the struggle joined
the most active members of the liberal party, Arguelles,
Quintana and others, who, all honourable and patriotic characters,
had acted in perfect sincerity in forming the Constitution
of 1812, as it was called, which they hoped would
secure the future freedom of the country.</p>

<p>In this, however, they found themselves mistaken; the representative
system had scarcely time to develope its advantages,
when it was overthrown entirely on the return of Ferdinand
to Spain, who, by his decree of the 4th of May, 1814,
annulled the Constitution, and dissolved the Cortes. Had he
been contented with this, as in re-assumption of the regal
authority exercised by his predecessors, the liberal party
might have had only to lament the abrupt termination of
their hopes. But, unfortunately, proceedings still more arbitrary
were commenced against their leaders individually, of a
nature unknown, even in Spain, till then, and in comparison
with which the rule of the Prince of the Peace was a pattern
of toleration. As those leaders had not been guilty of any
act which could make them amenable to any legal tribunal,
Ferdinand VII. took on himself to pass the sentences he
chose to inflict on them for the opinions they had held, and
the conduct they had pursued, in the momentous struggle for
national independence, resulting in his restoration. The partisans
of the Absolute King wished to extort from Martinez
de la Rosa a retractation of the opinions he had maintained;
but they miscalculated his character. He refused to listen
to their overtures, and he was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment
in the penal settlement of Gomera in Africa.</p>

<p>In 1820 a reaction took place, and the constitutional party
again obtained possession of the government. Martinez de
la Rosa had then passed six years of unjust imprisonment,
when he was recalled to Spain, and was received, in his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>native
city, with triumphal arches erected to welcome him, and other
tokens of public respect and rejoicing. At the first election
of deputies afterwards for the Cortes, he was sent with that
character from Granada, but his sentiments on public affairs
had become considerably modified. Others of the liberal
party had returned from exile or imprisonment with exasperated
feelings; but Martinez de la Rosa had employed his
time more philosophically, in considering the means that
should be adopted, to use his own expression, “for resolving
the problem, most important for the human race, how to
unite order with liberty.” Avoiding all extreme opinions, he
gave his support to the ministry he found existing and their
successors, as the means of preserving order, until they fell
under the combination of unworthy jealousies among their
own party, and the constant attacks of those holding the extreme
opinions of democracy and absolutism.</p>

<p>On the 1st March, 1821, Martinez de la Rosa was called
on to form a ministry, which duty he finally undertook,
though he had at first strenuously declined it. He had good
reason to decline it, as the king himself was throughout that
period plotting against his own ministers and government, to
re-establish himself in absolute power. At the end of June,
Martinez de la Rosa found himself under the necessity of
tendering his resignation, and insisting upon its being accepted,
though both the king and the council at first refused
to do so. The moderate course which he wished to follow
pleased neither party; and even he, who had suffered six years
of unjust imprisonment in the popular cause, was now looked
on as a traitor by the people, and ran great risk of being
murdered in a public commotion raised in the city. Had he
chosen to take a more decisive part, either on the one side or
the other, the weight of his character would no doubt have
given it the preponderance. As it was, the question was decide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>d
by the invasion of the French under the Duc d’Angoulême,
who restored Ferdinand VII. to his former authority.</p>

<p>When the French entered Spain, the constitutionalist government
had retired to Seville; but Martinez de la Rosa
had been obliged, from illness, to remain at Madrid. There
being called upon to give in his adhesion to the authority
imposed by foreign arms on the nation, he declined to do so,
and thought himself fortunate in having no severer penalty
to suffer thereupon, than to have his passport given him to
go from Spain, while others had to suffer so much more
severely. He then retired to Paris, where he resided eight
years, paying occasional visits to Italy, and though not proscribed
directly as an exile, yet he was not allowed to return
to his country.</p>

<p>During those eight years he devoted his leisure to literary
pursuits, and composed most of those works on which
his fame must permanently rest; such as his poem, ‘Arte
Poetica;’ his very beautiful ‘Ode on the Death of the Duchess
de Frias,’ and several plays; among them the ‘Tragedy of
the Conspiracy of Venice,’ considered the best of all he had
written. Thus occupied in endeavouring to make future
generations wiser and better, Martinez de la Rosa gained
increased respect at home with his increased reputation
abroad; and on the moderating of the first angry party-feelings
in Spain, was at the end of eight years allowed to return
to Granada.</p>

<p>The events of 1830 had produced the effect in Spain of
milder councils being adopted in the government, which prevailed
still more on the Queen Christina assuming power,
first on the illness of the king, and afterwards as Regent on
his death in 1833. Martinez de la Rosa had then been permitted
to return to Madrid, and in this latter year he published
the first collection of his poems, dedicating himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
writing at the same time his ‘Life of Perez del Pulgar,’ one
of the old warriors of Spain, and other works. From these
labours he was then called to undertake again the duties of
government. The existing ministry formed under a former
line of policy, was not suitable to the exigences of the times,
rendered still more pressing now by the pretensions of Don
Carlos to the throne. It was necessary to oppose those pretensions,
by obtaining the zealous aid of the constitutional
party; and Martinez de la Rosa was chosen as the leader,
embodying in himself the characteristics of moderation and
just principles, to form a ministry.</p>

<p>It does not become a foreigner, least of all in a purely
literary work, to enter in judgement on any questions of a
political nature. The best-intentioned persons in the world
may take different views of the same question, under the
same emergences, and the wisdom of any particular measure
is not always to be judged of by the result. In the conflicts of
contending parties, the most unscrupulous and daring may
often succeed, where wiser and better men may fail. Of
Martinez de la Rosa, his biographer has observed, that “he
was one of those men who would not conspire even for good
ends unlawfully; and that if he could not obtain what he
wished by just means, he would cross his arms, and leave the
rest to Providence.” The events of those years present
much ground for regret for all parties, and it is a truly
honourable consideration for such a one as Martinez de la
Rosa, that, acting according to the best of his judgement
on many very difficult occasions, he might have been compelled
to yield to force and violence, without any imputation
on his probity or statesmanship.</p>

<p>But if it be beyond our consideration of duty to enter on
questions of internal polity, there are two others, connected
with his administration, to which we may venture to refer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>, as
to be judged of by those great principles of right and justice,
which are applicable to all times and all countries, and become
thus fairly subject to commendation or censure, as
affecting the general interests of mankind.</p>

<p>Though Martinez de la Rosa had been one of the principal
actors among those who had established the Constitution of
1812, for which also he suffered as a prisoner and an exile,
he learned soon to perceive that it required considerable
modifications in a country like Spain, where the people were
not fully prepared to receive it. One of his first measures
then was to promulgate what might be termed a new Constitution,
called the Estatuto Real, the general wisdom and
propriety of which may be admitted, or at least not disputed,
while one part of it may be pronounced indefensible. This
was in the design to subvert the ancient <a href="#note31" title="See note">rights of the Basque
people</a>, by amalgamating their provinces into the kingdom,
without obtaining or asking their assent. This was a measure
unjust in itself; and because unjust, also impolitic; leading
to a long-protracted struggle, in which the whole force
of Spain being employed, army after army was destroyed,
and general after general disgraced, by a comparatively inconsiderable
number of undisciplined peasantry. When England
sought to incorporate the Parliaments of Scotland and
Ireland into that of the United Kingdom, it was sought by
what might be called legal, though not always honourable
means. On the same principle, the consent of the Basques
ought to have been obtained by the Spanish government,
rather than the attempt made, furtively or forcibly, to deprive
them of their ancient privileges.</p>

<p>On another great question affecting humanity, it is pleasing
to consider Martinez de la Rosa among the foremost characters
of the age, in attempting the suppression of the slave
trade with Africa. In 1817 a treaty was made between England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and Spain to suppress this traffic, which, after the experience
of a few years, it was found necessary to make more
stringent. Propositions to this effect were therefore made
year after year to successive Spanish governments by the British,
but in vain, until in 1835 Lord Palmerston was successful
enough to find in him a minister of Spain, who had the courage
to consent to those suggestions. The treaty of that year was
then entered into, and signed on the part of the two countries,
by Sir George Villiers, now Earl of Clarendon, and
Martinez de la Rosa, which has had the desired effect of preventing
the trade being protected by the Spanish flag. But
this able statesman has done still more, to entitle him to the
respect of all who look with interest on this important question.
One of the stipulations of the treaty declared that a
penal law should be passed in Spain, in accordance with it,
to punish all Spanish subjects found infringing it. This
stipulation no other Spanish minister could be found to fulfil;
and after the lapse of ten years, having again come into
power, it was left for him in good faith to accomplish the
engagement he had previously undertaken. Accordingly in
1845, he passed a law, answering the purposes required, which
received the approbation of the British government, and which
seems to have been so far effective in its application.</p>

<p>Great, undoubtedly, is the praise due to those philanthropic
statesmen, who, even at the Congress of Vienna, agreed to
protect the liberty of Africa. But much greater must be
acknowledged due to one who, unsupported almost in his own
country, having to oppose himself to a strong colonial interest,
and the cry they raised against him of acting in subservience
to a foreign power, yet had the moral courage to
follow the dictates of justice and humanity, on behalf of an
injured race, notwithstanding all the enmity he had to encounter
in so doing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1836 Martinez de la Rosa had to yield his place in the
government to other hands; and in 1840 he thought proper
to retire again to Paris, engaging himself in those literary
pursuits from which he had latterly been estranged. It is
not our province to follow his political course, through the
different public questions on which he had to act. During
the four intermediate years various ministries were formed,
to some of which he had to give an honourable support, to
others as honourable an opposition; but the Regency of
Espartero he avoided to acknowledge. When this fell under
the attack of Narvaez, he came forward again into public life,
and accepted office for a short time in the government; but
seemed resolved to take the first opportunity of giving up
the post of active exertion for one of more private character,
though of no less public utility. Accordingly, on the accession
of Pius IX. to the Papacy, he was appointed Ambassador
to Rome, which important office he still continues to hold,
for the advantage of the Roman Catholic church itself, as
well as of his own country, in the several questions that have
come since under discussion, subject to his intervention.</p>

<p>As a politician, Martinez de la Rosa has been conspicuous for
constant rectitude and consistency of principles. “Not even
in moments of the utmost defamation,” says his biographer,
“has a word been ever raised against his purity of conduct,
nor have his greatest enemies ever permitted themselves to
impugn in the least his intentions.” As an orator, he has
had few to equal him in his time, none to surpass him; but
his eloquence has been modelled by his character to persuade
and defend rather than attack; and thus, if not abounding in
brilliant sallies, it has been found of more essential service
to the cause of good government.</p>

<p>Beyond the ‘History of Perez del<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> Pulgar,’ Martinez de la
Rosa has written several other works in prose, one of which,
the latest, entitled ‘Spirit of the Age,’ is in fact, so far as
yet published, a History of the French Revolution, preceded
by a few general observations on political questions. It has
already advanced to six volumes, and becoming a political
and philosophical history of contemporaneous events, may be
extended to the utmost limits. A novel which he wrote
earlier in life, ‘Donna de Solis,’ is acknowledged a failure,
as showing “that no man, however eminent, can write successfully
on all kinds of subjects.”</p>

<p>The principal literary success which Martinez de la Rosa
has had, seems to have been as a dramatist; but into those
works it would be impossible to enter, to treat them with
justice, except by making them a prominent subject of consideration.
His poems, published as before stated in 1833,
contain compositions in various styles, from the light Anacreontic
to the project of an Epic Poem on the Wars of
Granada, of which, however, he has only published fragments.
Besides a translation of Horace’s ‘Art of Poetry,’ he has also
given the world an ‘Ars Poetica,’ for the benefit of his own
countrymen, which he has enriched with many excellent
notes and criticisms.</p>

<p>Some of the rules laid down in this ‘Ars Poetica’ are well
worthy of study, as giving room for reflection, for carrying
their suggestions even further than he has done. Thus, while
insisting on the young poet depending on the excellency of
his ear for the melody of verse, instead of having to count
the syllables for the requisite purpose, he observes, that as
the ancients regulated their metres by time, making so many
long or short feet of equivalent measure, of which the judgement
must depend on the cadence, so in the verses of the
best Spanish poets, there are often some lines containing
three or four more syllables than others, to which they form
the counterpart, and which are read in the same measure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
with increased pleasure for the variation.</p>

<p>The same <a href="#note32" title="See note">observation may apply to English verse</a>, though
perhaps not so fully. Many of our syllables containing
shortly sounded vowels, such as a Hebrew scholar might call
Sheva and its compounds, pronounced distinctly, but two in
the time of an ordinary syllable, may be found to give an
elegance to the line, which would sound faulty with only one
of them. But we may go further, and observe, that as in
music the melody may be continued by the pause, instead of
a note in the bar, so in a line, a pause with one or more long
syllables may have the effect of a syllable, instead of the
sound or foot to make up the measure. Readers of poetry
will not require to be reminded of instances of this adaptation
of sounds, and if they notice any such lines in these
translations, they will perceive that they have been written
in accordance with the precepts referred to.</p>

<p>It must be acknowledged, that in the generality of his
poems, Martinez de la Rosa has not risen to any such height
of sublimity or fancy as to give him a place in the superior
class of poets. But one of the latest critical writers, Ferrer
del Rio, who has given a more disparaging estimate of his
poetical talents than justice might award, pronounces the
‘Epistle to the Duke de Frias’ as a composition for which
“judges the most grave and least complaisant might place him
on the top of Parnassus.” The ‘Remembrance of Spain,’ Del
Rio declares to be poor in images, without feeling or depth,
but with much of pastoral innocency. The ‘Return to Spain’
is, according to him, a mere itinerary of his travels, more
than an expression of pleasure on escaping from past evil.
But in the ‘Epistle to the Duke de Frias,’ he finds “true-felt
inspiration, an appropriate expression, and a plan well traced
out,”&mdash;“without vagueness or artificial labour, but with
phrases that soften and ideas that satisfy the mind,” becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the subject.</p>

<p>Another anonymous critic finds the writer dwelling too
much on the remembrance of his own sorrows, instead of
offering consolation to the mourner, and some incongruity in
felicitating him on having witnessed the last pangs of mortality.
But these topics, on such an occasion, are true to
nature. Grief is apt to be egotistical, and the mind cannot
but dwell on the subject in which it is absorbed. Nor is the
other a less natural suggestion; and thus we may observe,
that the great master of antiquity represents the sweetest of
his characters lamenting that she had not been by the side of
her lord at such a time, as the height of her misfortune, to
receive his last embrace, and his last word to be remembered
ever after:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Ἕκτορ, ἐμοὶ δὲ μάλιστα λελείψεται ἄλγεα λυγρά.</div>
<div class="verse">Οὐ γάρ μοι θνήσκων λεχέων ἐκ χεῖρας ὄρεξας</div>
<div class="verse">Οὐ δὲ τί μοι εἶπες πυκινὸν ἔπος, οὖ τέ κεν αἰεὶ</div>
<div class="verse">Μεμνῄμην νύκτας τε καὶ ἤματα δακρυχέουσα.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this ‘Epistle to the Duke de Frias,’ Martinez de la Rosa
has also introduced, as a fit consideration in his grief, the
same topic of the instability of earthly things, which “<a href="#note33" title="See note">the
Roman friend of Rome’s least mortal mind</a>” offered him on
a similar occasion of sympathy. But it also seems a favourite
subject of our poet’s thoughts at all times, as befitting the
philosopher and the scholar, to dwell on the passing nature
of worldly greatness, and so lead the mind to higher suggestions
than those of the present moment. These ideas he
has carried further in another work he has published, ‘Book
for Children,’ in which, like many other eminent characters,
who have given the aid of their talents to the development of
juvenile minds, he has inculcated lessons of virtue, and the
instinct of good taste, with the feelings of patriotism and
religion, as the basis of moral well-being.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Martinez de la Rosa published his works in a collected
form first, in five volumes, 1827-30, at Paris, where they
have been again lately reprinted. Besides these, there have
been two editions in Spain, one at Madrid and the other at
Barcelona. From Her Catholic Majesty he has received the
decoration of the Golden Fleece, the highest order of Spain,
besides other similar honours. But the world at large will
consider his greatest honour to consist in having raised himself
from mediocrity of station, by his talents and exertions,
to the high position he has attained “without stain or reproach,”
while, by his literary works, he has enabled all mankind
to become benefited by his genius, and interested in his
fame.</p>

<span class="smaller">ANGEL DE SAAVEDRA,
DUKE DE RIVAS.</span></h3>

<p>There are few persons to whom Fortune can be said to have
“come with both hands full,” more truly than to the illustrious
subject of this notice; even the very reverses of life,
which have fallen to his lot, have come like favours; as they
have been incurred honourably, and have proved the harbingers
of many advantages.</p>

<p>Angel de Saavedra was born at Cordova, the 1st March,
1791, the second son of Don Juan Martin de Saavedra,
Duke de Rivas, and Donna Maria Ramirez, Marchioness of
Andia, Grandees of Spain, both persons not less eminent for
private virtues than for their exalted rank. He received
his primary education under his father’s care; but he dying
in 1802, Angel was then removed to the College of Nobles
at Madrid. In accordance with the privileges then enjoyed
by youths of noble birth, he was, while yet a child of ten
months, nominated a cornet of cavalry, and held a commission
as captain when but seven years old. At that age, pursuing
his studies, it was observed that he did not show much
application or inclination for abstruser subjects; but his quickness
of apprehension, and felicity of memory gave him a sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>eriority
over his companions, many of whom were distinguished
for much greater industry. History and poetry were, from
his earliest years, his favourite subjects of study; and in original
compositions and translations from the classics, he then
already began to show the bent of his genius. At the same
time he also began to show his great talent for drawing, in
which art, no less than in poetry, he has so much excelled;
and it is recorded that for the greatest punishment to be
awarded him for juvenile delinquencies, it was found sufficient
to take away his pencils, and forbid his taking his
drawing lesson for the day.</p>

<p>In 1806 the regiment, to which he was attached, had orders
to join Napoleon’s army in Germany, with the Spanish contingent;
whereupon the Duchess de Rivas, as her son’s guardian,
procured his exchange into the Royal Guard, by which
he lost rank, having now only that of a sub-lieutenant, in the
rank as a guardsman. Having joined this corps in the beginning
of 1807, it was the lot of Don Angel to witness the
scenes which then occurred in the palace, little creditable to
any of the parties, including the arrest of the Prince of the
Asturias, afterwards Ferdinand VII., and the proceedings
against him. It was perhaps fortunate for the young guardsman
that he was so soon called into active service. A privileged
corps is always a dangerous trial for a young man
entering into life; though, in addition to his own right-mindedness,
he had the good fortune to be joined to the Flemish
battalion of the guard, where he became intimate with a
young Belgian officer of kindred tastes and character, who,
by example and association, confirmed him in his inclinations.
He also became acquainted with some other young men who
had the conducting of a literary periodical, to which he contributed
several articles, both in prose and verse. For a
young man of sixteen, desirous of distinction, this was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
privilege which could not fail of producing good results in
subsequent improvement, if his early efforts were found to be
approved, as an encouragement to continue them.</p>

<p>From such occupations was Saavedra called away soon, to
engage in the important events, upon which the future fate of
his country was to depend. Napoleon’s troops had crossed
the Pyrenees, and under pretence of marching through the
country to Portugal, had seized upon the principal fortresses
of Spain. The Court of Madrid, aware too late of the
treachery intended, was thrown into irremediable confusion,
heightened by the internal dissensions of the royal family.
The troops at Madrid were summoned in haste to the king
at Aranjuez, when Saavedra among them witnessed the pitiable
scenes, which ended in the abdication of Charles IV.
and the declaration of Ferdinand VII., in whose escort he returned
to Madrid. But the French armies were already in
possession of the country, and had the royal family in their
power. They soon had further possession of Madrid, and
the guards, in which Saavedra’s elder brother, the Duke de
Rivas, was also serving with him, were ordered away to the
Escurial, as the French leaders were aware of the part they
had taken at Aranjuez, and were fearful of their influence
with the people, in the course of resistance then widely
spreading against the invaders.</p>

<p>Murat, then chief of the French forces, and of the provisional
government, had good reason to fear that so influential
a body as the Royal Guards, all composed of individuals
of rank, might be induced to take part with the insurrectionists
in the rising struggle; and he therefore sent to
them to the Escurial, one of the principal Spanish officers,
also one of the Royal Guard, who had attached himself to
the French interest, to persuade the others to join the same
cause. This officer having accordingly come to the Escur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>ial,
called together the members of the guard, and stating to
them that the students of the Military College at Segovia
were in a state of rebellion against the authorities, expressed
Murat’s wish that the guards should join the French troops
to suppress the movement, to prevent further ill-consequences.
The assembly received the proposal at first in silence and
perplexity. But it was one of those occasions when a right
mind and strong heart availed more than conventional dignity;
and thus, though perhaps the youngest person present,
Angel de Saavedra rose up, and with all the impetuosity of
youth, declared in impassioned language, that “none of the
guard would do treason to their country, or become an instrument
of foreign tyranny, for the oppression and punishment
of their companions in arms.” He therefore, in the
name of his comrades, gave a positive refusal to the mandate.</p>

<p>In this, his first harangue, the spirit was as noble, as the
sentiments were bold and patriotic. The manner in which
it was received showed that it was also in unison with the
feelings of the rest of the guard, and Murat’s messenger was
obliged to content himself with attempting to reprove the
young officer, who had ventured to speak before others, so
much his superiors in rank and service. But his efforts were
of no avail, and he had to return to Madrid, with the information
that the guards were also apparently about to join
the national party. These passed the night in watch, with
their arms and horses prepared, for whatever might be the
result. In the morning they received orders to return to
Madrid, and obeying the order, at halting for the night,
came to deliberate on the course they should adopt. Some
thought it would be better to disperse, and go to their respective
provinces, to join the several parties already armed in
resistance against the invaders. Others, among whom were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the two brothers, Saavedra and the Duke de Rivas, thought
it would be better for them to keep united, and join as a
body, with their standards, the first effective Spanish force
they could meet. Unfortunately there was no one of sufficient
authority present to command; and the first suggestion,
where most of them naturally wished to share the fates of
their families, prevailed. Accordingly they dispersed, and
the two brothers entered Madrid secretly, finding that those
who remained together were too few to remain as a body,
against the numerous bands of the enemy spread over the
country.</p>

<p>The first wish of the brothers was to join Palafox at Zaragoza,
and they started for that purpose with false passports;
but found the road too closely beset by the French. In one
place, however, they met with a mischance on the other side;
where the people, now risen against the invaders, fancied that
the travellers who were going armed so mysteriously, were
emissaries of the French, and would listen to no declaration
to the contrary. Fortunately there happened to be in the
town a comrade of the guard, well known there, who hearing
the uproar, came and recognized the prisoners, and assuring
the multitude of their true character, made them be received
with as much enthusiastic welcome, as they had just before
been with violence.</p>

<p>Turning from this course, the two brothers then hastened
back to join the forces under Castanios, flushed with their
triumph at Bailen; and at Sepulveda, Angel Saavedra had
his first encounter in fight with the French. With the army
he joined, he found about 200 of his comrades of the guards,
and these, as a body, now effected much service in the various
skirmishes and actions that took place. They had these with
varied success at Ucles, Tudela, and other places, where the
two brothers distinguished themselves by their activity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
bravery. At Tudela the Duke had his horse killed, and
received several contusions, which resulted in a fever, on
account of which his brother had to take him to their mother’s
care at Cordova.</p>

<p>Having recovered from this, they again joined the army,
and were present at “the memorable battle of Talavera,”
after which they had to share in the several encounters of
Caminias, Madrilejos and Herencia. But now a severer trial
awaited them. On the 18th of November, 1809, on the eve
of the disastrous battle of Ocania, the French and Spanish
forces had an encounter at Antigola, when the Royal Guards,
under the Duke de Rivas, though pressed by superior numbers,
charged three times on the enemy, before they retired,
with the loss of one-third of their number, to Ocania.</p>

<p>In this skirmish, Angel Saavedra had his horse killed at
the beginning of the affray, and then had to fight hand to
hand at a disadvantage. Thus he soon received two wounds
in the head, and another in the breast from a lance which
prostrated him, and left him insensible, while the combatants
were riding over him and others laid in the same state.
About the middle of the night he recovered his sensibility,
and found he had been robbed of his clothes. He attempted to
rise, but fell down again, unable to move. Happily for him
he had sufficient strength to call to a man he saw near, who
proved to be a Spanish soldier seeking for spoils, and he,
learning the name of the wounded officer, put him on his
horse, and took him to his brother. The Duke, who had
already been searching for him, and had sent others out for
the same purpose unavailingly, now hastened to procure for
him medical assistance. With much difficulty he found a
surgeon, who, on seeing the patient, declared the case hopeless,
and left him to attend to others. The cold air had
arrested the bleeding, which now burst forth from the motion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of the horse and the warmth of the room used for the hospital,
so as to leave him apparently dying. The Duke was in despair,
when the people about him brought the barber of the
place to dress the wounds, which he did with great skill,
giving him hopes of success in saving his brother’s life.</p>

<p>As the morning broke, the drums were heard beating for
action, announcing the advance of the enemy. The Duke
had barely time to procure a common cart of the country
into which to place his brother, who was found to have no
fewer than eleven wounds upon him, and send him away with
seven other wounded companions, before he had to join his
troop. Going slowly along, the seven died by his side one
after another, and in a few hours they were overtaken by
fugitives, whose flight showed the ill-fortune of the day.
Saavedra might have shared this ill-fortune further; but one
of the escort knew the country well and took him along by-paths
to a retired place, where his wounds were again dressed,
and afterwards to Baeza, in which city he found better attendance.
There, after three weeks, all his wounds were healed,
except the one in the breast, and one in the hip, from which
he was lame for some years afterwards. He then was enabled
to proceed to his mother at Cordova, and there was received,
in his native place, with marks of public respect, which could
not fail of being very gratifying to his feelings, though at the
expense of so much suffering.</p>

<p>In the beginning of 1810 the French came marching towards
Cordova, and Saavedra and his mother fled to Malaga.
He had frequent bleeding, apparently from the lungs, and
his medical advisers were fearful that any extraordinary exertion
would have a fatal result. Before they could embark at
Malaga for any other place, the French had got possession of
the city, and Saavedra and the Duchess had to take refuge,
disguised, in a fisherman’s hut. In this extremity they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
found by a Spanish officer in the French interest, who had
formerly shared their hospitality at Cordova, and he repaid it
now by procuring for them passports and giving them the
means to get to Gibraltar, whence they passed over to Cadiz,
then the last hope of Spain.</p>

<p>Arrived at Cadiz, Saavedra was received with the consideration
due to his merits. He was put into active service, as
far as his strength would allow, and on the staff his talents
for drawing as well as for ready composition were found of
great value. Many of the military reports were written by
him; and he also wrote a defence of the military establishments
against a pamphlet which had been published, conducting
at the same time a military periodical, published
weekly, at Cadiz, throughout 1811. Thrown into association
with such men as the Conde de Noronia, Arriaza, Quintana,
and Martinez de la Rosa, his love for poetry was further excited,
and he composed verses like them, some of which have
been preserved among his later works, while he has allowed
others to be forgotten. He continued also cultivating his
taste for drawing, attending the schools at Cadiz to draw
from life as well as from the models; while at leisure moments
on duty he amused himself with sketching portraits of
his comrades, or of the scenes presented to their view.</p>

<p>But his military duties did not cease at Cadiz. Having
been sent out on important commissions with orders, he was
led away by his ardour to join in the encounter which took
place with the French at Chiclana, in forgetfulness of the
commission with which he was charged. Afterwards a division
of the army being found in a state of resistance to the
orders of the Regency, on account of their general refusing
to acknowledge the Duke of Wellington as commander-in-chief,
Saavedra was sent with full powers to arrest the disorder.
This he did effectually, drawing the division out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Cordova in good order, after deposing the general and other
chiefs of the insurrection, who but for this might have brought
further reverses on the Spanish arms, such as so many other
incapable officers had done previously, influenced in like
manner by their presumption and self-conceit.</p>

<p>Saavedra, so far from joining in the vanity and folly of
those of his countrymen, who fancied themselves competent to
act independently of the British commander, on the contrary,
sought to be employed on the staff under the immediate orders
of Lord Wellington, but he could not effect it. The wound in
his breast again occasioned large effusions of blood from the
mouth, and he was obliged to return to Seville, and ultimately
was quartered at Cordova. When the war came to an end,
he, under these circumstances, retired from military service
with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.</p>

<p>While at Cadiz, Saavedra had joined, unreservedly, in the
councils of those who framed and attempted to establish
in Spain the constitution of 1812. When Ferdinand VII.
returned and set it aside, he therefore fully expected that he
would be included in the proscription directed against Martinez
de la Rosa and others who had distinguished themselves
in the assertion of liberal opinions. But instead of this, the
king, who probably considered him more of a military than a
political character, received him favourably, and gave him the
rank of colonel, assigning him Seville for his residence. There
accordingly he retired, and while Spain was subjected to the
rule of absolutism, employed himself in literary pursuits and
drawing, for which the magnificent paintings of Murillo and
other Spanish masters in that city gave one of his inclinations
so great an incentive. In 1813 he published a volume of
poems, and in the following six years brought forward several
plays, some of which were represented at Seville with considerable
applause, and one had the “marked honour of being prohibited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
by the censorship.” These he republished in a second
edition of his works at Madrid in 1821, but though favourably
received at the time, they are all acknowledged now to be of
little merit. In fact, at that time, having studied principally
the later poets of the classical school as it was termed, his
mind had not yet attained that expansiveness and vigour
which subsequent years of study were destined to give it.</p>

<p>In 1820 Saavedra happened to be in Madrid, probably engaged
in superintending this edition of his works, when the
events of that year brought into power the party with whom
he had been associated at Cadiz at the time of the siege.
With characteristic ardour he entered again into close alliance
with them, resuming the principles he had previously maintained
with them. But though now those friends were in
office, he sought nothing for himself further than leave to
travel into neighbouring countries, which permission he had
sought in vain from the previous government. This favour
he now obtained, with full salary allowed, and a commission
to examine the military establishments of other nations, and
to report to the government on their advances and improvements.
He went accordingly to Paris, and after a careful
attention to the duties entrusted to him, was about proceeding
to Italy, when he was called back to Spain to engage in a
new career of public importance.</p>

<p>Before going to Paris, Saavedra had paid a short visit to
his native city, and there formed a close intimacy with Alcala
Galiano, one of the most learned and talented men of his age,
who, with Don Javier Isturitz (the present respected Minister
of her Catholic Majesty at London), was now at the head of
the government. Galiano, by the fascination of his eloquence,
had completely won the good feelings of the young poet, and
inspired by the desire of having so able and popular a follower
in the legislature, had procured his election as Deputy to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>the
Cortes from Cordova. Flattered by the favour shown him
by his fellow-townsmen, Saavedra entered with his accustomed
ardour on his duties, and was appointed Secretary to
the Cortes, where he came forward as one of the most vehement
speakers in the maintenance of liberal opinions. But
those opinions were not responded to by the great mass of
the people, and were opposed by the foreign courts of Europe.
Saavedra had voted for the removal of the court to Seville,
and there further voted for the suspension of the king and
his transference to Cadiz, when the entry of the French army
re-established Ferdinand on his throne. On the 1st October,
1822, Saavedra and Galiano had to take flight from Cadiz to
Gibraltar, where he remained till the following May, when
he proceeded to London to join the other emigrants there,
Isturitz, Galiano, the celebrated Arguelles, whom his countrymen,
on account of his remarkable eloquence, have termed
the divine, and others.</p>

<p>Even during his short political career, Saavedra had continued
his literary pursuits, and now in London he renewed
them, writing his poem ‘Florinda’ and minor pieces, as well as
continuing his recreative art of drawing. For his participation
in the proceedings against the king, he had been sentenced
to death, and his property had been sequestrated. This same
measure had been visited on his brother, the Duke de Rivas,
who had taken part also in the proceedings, and thus Saavedra
had become reduced to very straitened circumstances. Their
mother, with natural feeling, forwarded him all the supplies
in her power; but these were scanty, and it was necessary for
him to seek means of subsistence for himself. He therefore
determined on going to Italy to perfect himself in the art of
painting, as the best means of employment left him, finding
the climate of England also too rigorous for his constitution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>As the Spanish emigrants were forbidden to go to Italy,
the Duchess de Rivas besought the Pope’s Nuncio at Madrid
to grant her son a passport and obtain for him permission to
go there for the purposes specified. The Nuncio having
communicated with Rome, was enabled to reply, that “as
Don Angel Saavedra engaged neither to speak nor to write
on political subjects in Italy, nor to frequent English society,
his passport would be granted him, assuring him he would
there find hospitality and protection.” The required securities
having been given, and the Nuncio’s authorization obtained,
on which he had himself written, “Given by express order
of His Holiness,” Saavedra left London in December, 1824,
for Gibraltar, where he remained till the June following. In
the meantime he there married, according to previous arrangement,
Donna Maria de la Encarnacion Cueto, daughter of a
distinguished colonel of artillery, and then, with his young
wife, proceeded to Leghorn. Arrived at this city, and presenting
his passport to the Roman consul, he was told that,
notwithstanding the assurances given him, he was now forbidden
to go to Rome; besides which he received an order
from the Tuscan government to leave their territories within
three days. Finding all remonstrances useless, Saavedra now,
in right of a passport from Gibraltar, applied for aid to the
British consul, who took him to his house, and as the only
means of putting him in safety, embarked him on board a
small Maltese vessel then about to sail for that island. After
a protracted voyage, with wretched accommodations and subjected
to great peril in a storm, when the men abandoned
their tasks, and the captain and Saavedra had to compel
them by blows even to resume their labours, they at length
reached Malta. Here Saavedra intended to have remained
only until he could obtain the means of returning to Gibraltar;
but the advantages of climate, of cheapness of living,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and the reception he met with from the English authorities,
induced him to continue there, until his stay at length extended
to five years’ residence.</p>

<p>Fortunately for him, there happened then to be residing at
Malta Mr. J. H. Frere, formerly British Minister at Madrid,
who, in addition to a highly cultivated taste and great general
knowledge, was well conversant with the Spanish language
and literature also in particular. With this gentleman
Saavedra soon entered into terms of intimate friendship, and
was taught by him to turn his thoughts from the tame class of
poetry he had copied from the French school, and elevate his
mind to the high tone of the older poets of Spain, as well as
to the study of English literature. These lessons he followed,
and thus proved another instance of the remark of Plutarch,
that the Muses often suggest the best and most approved
productions of genius, taking exile as their means to aid them:
Καὶ γὰρ τοῖς παλαιοῖς (ὥς ἔοικεν) αἱ Μοῦσαι τὰ κάλλιστα
τῶν συνταγμάτων καὶ δοκιμώτατα, φυγὴν λάβουσαι σύνεργον,
ἐπετέλεσαν.</p>

<p>At first Saavedra continued his former style of writing,
but after a short time his mind seemed suddenly to expand,
and to act under the influence of another genius. He finished,
after his arrival at Malta, his poem of ‘Florinda,’ and wrote
there several plays, of the same character as those he had
formerly written, but at the same time showed that a change
was coming over his mind, by an ‘Ode to the Lighthouse at
Malta,’ known to the reader by Mr. Frere’s translation of it,
which for spirit and range of thought proved itself the offspring
of another and truer inspiration. The expectations
thus raised were destined to be fully realized, and the poem
he then began, and published subsequently, the ‘Moro
Esposito,’ or ‘Foundling Moor,’ proved one of a class entirely
unknown to Spanish literature, but quite in accordan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>ce
with the national genius, so as to be at once accepted by
the Spanish public, as entitled to their unqualified admiration.
To use the words of <a href="#note36" title="See note">his biographer, Pastor Diaz</a>, himself
a writer of considerable reputation, “This work, which
had no model, nor has yet had a rival, is one of the most
precious jewels of our literature, and in our judgement the
most beautiful flower of his poetic crown.”</p>

<p>But it was not to poetry alone that Saavedra gave his
attention at Malta. He continued also his application to
painting, not having forgotten his original intention of
adopting this art professionally. Notwithstanding <a href="#note37" title="See note">the advantages
he enjoyed there</a>, however, he was anxious to be
nearer his own country, and sought permission to go to
France, for which purpose he had an English vessel of war
assigned to take him to Marseilles. On arriving there, instead
of being allowed to go to Paris as he desired, he was
directed to fix his residence at Orleans, where, having exhausted
the means afforded him for subsistence, he found it
necessary to establish a school for drawing. In this he met
with some success, having obtained various pupils and commissions
for portraits, and a painting which he had finished
with care and ability having been bought at a high price for
the museum of the city. Four others of his paintings are
in the choir of the cathedral at Seville.</p>

<p>After a few months’ residence at Orleans, the revolution of
July, 1830, allowed him to go to Paris, where he found his
valued friends Isturitz and Galiano, both, like himself, having
moderated the warmth of early opinions by the effect of observation
as well as of time. Instead of interfering in political
questions therefore, he continued his artistic labours.
Several portraits he had painted appeared in the Exhibition of
1831 at the Louvre, and his name is to be found in the list
for that year of professional artists established in Paris. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
consequence of the cholera having broken out there, Saavedra
soon after retired to Tours, where he finished his poem, the
‘Moro Esposito,’ and the Tragedy, ‘Don Alvaro,’ publishing
the former at Paris in two volumes, in 1833.</p>

<p>On the death of Ferdinand VII., under the milder sway
of Queen Christina, the emigrants hitherto excluded from
Spain were allowed to return to their country. Angel
Saavedra hastened to take advantage of the amnesty, and
arrived in Spain the 1st of January, 1834, to take the oaths
required; after which he took up his residence at Madrid,
and gave his adhesion to the government over which Martinez
de la Rosa then presided. Now, however, an important
change came over his fortunes, which brought him still more
prominently before the world, and involved him again in the
vicissitudes of public life.</p>

<p>On the 15th of May, 1834, his elder brother died without
children; and Angel Saavedra thereupon succeeded to his
honours as Duke de Rivas, and to the family estates entailed
with the title. As a Grandee of Spain, the new Duke had
to take his place in the Chamber of Peers, where he was
chosen, on the 24th of July following, second Secretary, and
shortly after, first Secretary of the Chamber and Vice-President.
Here again, as formerly in the Cortes, he then took
his part in the public debates, having on several occasions
shown himself to possess great oratorical abilities. One
speech he made on the exclusion of Don Carlos and his
descendants from the Spanish throne, has been particularly
mentioned as combining much eloquence with high political
considerations.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding his elevation and parliamentary duties,
he still continued his literary pursuits. Having finished the
Tragedy of ‘Don Alvaro,’ he now brought it forward, and it
is not too much to say that never had a drama been produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
in Spain of so high a character, or that was attended with
such success. At first it was received with wonder, then
with long and loud applause; it was repeated at every theatre
in Spain, and still continues to excite the admiration of audiences,
casting into the shade all his former dramatic productions,
and in fact causing a revolution in the dramatic
art of the Spanish stage. The old worn-out characters and
constantly recurring self-same incidents that had encumbered
the scenes have since been swept away, and a higher tone
has been in consequence adopted by later writers, though
still this remarkable production remains without a rival on
the Spanish stage. Yet it is not without faults, and it has
been subjected to severe criticisms; but on the representation,
so absorbing is the interest which it is said to excite,
that all faults are lost sight of in admiration. The subject
of the drama is that of the old Greek tragedy, Fatality.
Don Alvaro is an Œdipus, destined for misfortune, and not
even religion can save him from his mission of crime. “It is
a character which belongs to no determinate epoch, perhaps
more universal in this as it belongs to all, like the heroes of
Shakespeare.” There can be no question but that it was
the study of Shakespeare which elevated his genius to the
production of this masterpiece of the modern Spanish theatre,
as had the study of Walter Scott and Byron enabled him to
give the world the great poem of the ‘Moro Esposito.’</p>

<p>On the 15th of May, 1836, the Duke de Rivas was called
on to join the government formed by his friends Isturitz and
Galiano, to which he consented with much reluctance. But
this ministry was doomed to be of short duration, and was
overthrown in the midst of popular commotions. The Duke
had to take refuge in the house of the British Minister, the
present Earl of Clarendon, where he remained twenty-four
days, refusing to emigrate as others of his colleagues had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
done, though at last he felt himself compelled to do so.
With much difficulty he then escaped, and after many perils,
passing through Portugal, arrived at Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The moderate counsels of the Isturitz ministry were not
agreeable to the temper of the public, and thus the Duke de
Rivas was now driven into banishment by his former friends
the liberals, as he had formerly been by their mutual enemies
the Absolutists. At Gibraltar he thereupon remained a year,
dedicating himself again to poetry and painting, having then
composed much of his next, and perhaps most popular work,
‘Historical Romances.’ On the promulgation of the constitution
of 1837, accepted by the Queen, the Duke gave in
his adhesion to it, and was thus enabled to return to his
family from his second exile, on the 1st of August of that
year.</p>

<p>In the ensuing elections, the Duke was elected Senator
for Cadiz, when, in consonance with his principles, he gave
his general support to the ministry, and distinguished himself
by several animated discourses he pronounced in the
Chamber; particularly one in favour of returning to the
nunneries their sequestrated properties, and another for
maintaining to the Basque provinces their ancient privileges
and rights. For this just and disinterested advocacy of their
interests, the constituents inhabiting the two provinces of
Biscay and Alava respectively elected him to the Senate in
1840, though the government which then existed did not
think proper to sanction their choice.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, another change occurred in the government,
and under the administration of Narvaez, the Duke de
Rivas was appointed Minister from Her Catholic Majesty to
the Court at Naples, in which city he continued upwards of
five years in that mission; during also the residence of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>Pius
IX. there, while a fugitive from Rome. On the marriage of
the Conde de Montemolin, eldest son of Don Carlos, with a
sister of the King of the two Sicilies, he demanded his passport,
leaving his post, for which he received the approbation
of his sovereign. Since his return to Spain, the Duke has
been again appointed Vice-President of the Senate, but
seems to have taken little part in public affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Borrow, in his very amusing work, ‘The Bible in
Spain,’ describes the Duke de Rivas, in 1836, as “a very
handsome man;” and so his portraits represent him, agreeing
with all the accounts of his personal appearance and courtly
manners. Favoured by fortune with the possession of high
rank and ample means, he has been still further favoured in
his domestic relations, and with a large family, the solace of
his age. We have thus traced him through life, distinguished,
in every stage in which he has had to exert himself, for
eminent ability as well as honourable conduct. As a soldier,
engaged in the noblest of causes, the defence of his country,
he showed himself conspicuous among the most active and
bravest of her defenders. In public life, as an orator, a
diplomatist and a statesman, he has proved equally eminent.
In private life, he has been no less exemplary for the exercise
of the domestic virtues, having in his needs exerted himself
to discharge his duty to his family, by the practice of the
talents with which he had been endowed, as an artist of
superior proficiency. As a dramatist, his works have in
that most difficult department gained the fullest success;
and in poetry he is the only modern writer in Spain who has
given the world a poem of the highest class, combining
varied incidents with well-drawn characters and a sustained
interest. Our greatest poet of modern days felt constrained
to say,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent9">I twine</div>
<div class="verse">My hopes of being remember’d in my line</div>
<div class="verse">With my land’s language;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and in such aspirations may the Duke de Rivas indulge in
the retrospect of his past labours to ensure for him a like
future remembrance.</p>

<p>Passing by the poems written under the influence of an
adhesion to the rules of the classical school, we find the
poem of the ‘Moro Esposito,’ or ‘Cordova and Burgos in
the fifteenth century,’ well-deserving of being classed with
the poetical romances of Sir Walter Scott, on the model of
which it was written. The subject is the History of the
Seven Infantes of Lara, made known to the English reader
by Southey and Lockhart, and it contains many passages of
extraordinary merit, though severe criticism would point out
many faults. “To make felt,” says his biographer, “or to
record all the beauties of this book, a book as large would be
necessary, and they may well compensate for the defects,
notwithstanding that at times those same beauties make us
see at what small cost the author might have sent forth his
work more finished.” As in every-day life, he has joined in
his narration scenes of the most opposite character, the most
magnificent descriptions with what is most ludicrous, and
the tenderest with what is oppressing to sensibility. The
passages referring to his native city of Cordova are peculiarly
beautiful, and show the feelings of the exile, as they lean to
his country, in all ages and under all circumstances,&mdash;to
“sweet Argos” or sacred Athens&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">The dedication to Mr. Frere has the singularity of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
written in the English language.</p>

<p>The ‘Ode to the Lighthouse at Malta’ is another exemplification
of the Duke’s patriotic feeling, as well as the poem
of ‘The Exile,’ which has been translated into English by
Mr. Reade. One of his latest works is in the form of a
drama, but, like those of Lord Byron, it is not intended for
the stage. It is entitled, ‘Undeception in a Dream,’ and represents
the life of man, contrasting its vicissitudes and events
with his hopes and desires. Like the tragedy of ‘Alvaro,’ it is
a highly poetical conception, and worthy of the reputation of
the noble writer.</p>

<p>It has already been intimated that the most popular of the
Duke’s works is one published at Madrid in 1841, ‘Historical
Romances,’ from which has been taken, for translation, the
‘Alcazar of Seville.’ These romances are, in fact, ballads on
various subjects in Spanish history, written in the ballad
measure of octosyllabic lines, with asonante rhymes for the
second and fourth of each quatrain, similar to our own ballads.
In the prologue to this work the Duke has written a defence
of this measure, which required no defence beyond his own
adoption of it, with the example of such writers in it as Melendez
and Arriaza in modern times, and almost all the best
writers in the language previously. Ochoa has praised “above
all” the romance of the Conde de Villa Mediana, and readers
generally find most interesting the ‘Tale of a Veteran,’ so
that it may require an explanation for the choice of the one
taken, that the character of <a href="#note38" title="See note">Pedro, surnamed the Cruel</a>, was
best known to the English public, as associated with English
history. That of the Conde de Villa Mediana is a lively description
of some scenes which led to his assassination by order
of the king, who was influenced by jealousy; the ‘Tale of the
Veteran’ gives an account of an adventure in a nunnery, where
a nun invites an officer to her cell and poisons him in revenge
for his slight to her sister. She then shows him the corpse
of a brother officer, who had already fallen a victim to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
arts for the like wrong to herself, and she tells him the whole
history of her motives and conduct, while she induces him to
dig a grave for the first victim, with whom, she tells her
second, that he is also to be placed.</p>

<p>Few writers have given the world so many works of a
superior order, distinguishable separately for varied excellence,
as the Duke de Rivas. He has concentrated in his
later productions all the chief merits of a poet, in the choice
of his subjects, in the delineation of character and the power
of maintaining throughout the interest of the narrative. If
he has failed too often in the mechanical execution, in attending
to the harmony of verse or poetic expression of the
thoughts, these are faults which we may hope will be corrected
in subsequent editions, so as to leave him still greater
claims on the admiration of his readers.</p>

<div class="verse">Fill’d with a chosen concourse gay</div>
<div class="verse indent1">In country dance to meet,</div>

<div class="verse">Five hundred years shone younger</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The Alcazar to the day,</div>
<div class="verse">Its lofty walls yet lustrous,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And faultless its array;</div>
<div class="verse">And brilliant were the enamels</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Which its gilded roofs reveal,</div>
<div class="verse">It showed itself the mansion fit</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Of the king of proud Castile;</div>
<div class="verse">When on one balmy morn it chanced</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Of florid May betide,</div>
<div class="verse">In that saloon whose balcony</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Is on the plaza’s side,</div>
<div class="verse">Two persons of illustrious mien</div>
<div class="verse indent1">In silence deep were there;</div>
<div class="verse">One was a Cavalier, and one</div>
<div class="verse indent1">A Lady passing fair.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A Barbary carpet richly wove</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Upon the floor was laid,</div>
<div class="verse">The gift or tribute which the Moor</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Granada’s king had paid;</div>
<div class="verse">A silken curtain, bright with flowers,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And ribbons curious wrought,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
<div class="verse">With various eastern colours deck’d,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Which to our Spain had brought</div>
<div class="verse">Venetian galleys, as perchance</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Her Doge’s gift of state,</div>
<div class="verse">Was thrown across the balcony,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The light to moderate.</div>
<div class="verse">In the recess in front, with woods</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Well carved, and richly graced</div>
<div class="verse">With mother-o’-pearl inlayings,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Was an Oratory placed;</div>
<div class="verse">Where of the sovereign Virgin</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The image stood devout,</div>
<div class="verse">The sculpture somewhat rude, but yet</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Attractions not without;</div>
<div class="verse">Which with a plate of silver,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">For ornament was crown’d,</div>
<div class="verse">Its rim reflecting amethysts,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And emeralds around.</div>
<div class="verse">A manuscript of holy prayers,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Which miniatures adorn,</div>
<div class="verse">Precious with gold and ivory</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Upon its coverings borne,</div>
<div class="verse">Was seen there placed upon a stand,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Form’d of an angel’s wings,</div>
<div class="verse">The figure badly sculptured,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">But with neat finishings.</div>
<div class="verse">And on the floor of gold brocade</div>
<div class="verse indent1">A cushion one might see,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Which by its sunken pressure show’d</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The marks of bended knee.</div>
<div class="verse">And on the pure white walls were hung</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Bright arms along the space,</div>
<div class="verse">And interspersed were banners,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And trophies of the chase.</div>
<div class="verse">An ornamental table stood</div>
<div class="verse indent1">In the middle of the floor,</div>
<div class="verse">On which a well-tuned lute was placed,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Though partly covered o’er;</div>
<div class="verse">A rich-cut board for game of draughts,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And a coffer by its side</div>
<div class="verse">Of silver filigree, and jars</div>
<div class="verse indent1">With chosen flowers supplied.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The Lady near the balcony</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Sat very pensively,</div>
<div class="verse">In a great gilded chair of state,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Whose back was form’d to be</div>
<div class="verse">A canopy, or cover o’er,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And in gay curvings down</div>
<div class="verse">Were lions, castles, and the whole</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Surmounted with a crown.</div>
<div class="verse">Her dress a silken robe of green,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Which show’d a various tinge,</div>
<div class="verse">In twisted threads, with pearls and gold</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The embroidery and fringe.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Her head-dress than the snow appear’d</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Ev’n whiter to behold,</div>
<div class="verse">And covering o’er the fine clear lawn</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Her long dark tresses roll’d.</div>
<div class="verse">Her face was heavenly, and her neck</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Divine, but in their hue</div>
<div class="verse">Like wax, the colour which fear paints,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And long-known sorrow too.</div>
<div class="verse">Her eyes were like two beaming suns</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Beneath their lashes tall,</div>
<div class="verse">Where shone two precious pearly drops</div>
<div class="verse indent1">As ready down to fall.</div>
<div class="verse">She was a lily fair, whom death</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Was rudely threatening seen,</div>
<div class="verse">For a corroding worm the heart</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Was tearing deep within.</div>
<div class="verse">Now in her thin pale hands, convulsed</div>
<div class="verse indent1">It seems with fear or doubt,</div>
<div class="verse">Her kerchief white, of border’d lace</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And points, she twists about;</div>
<div class="verse">Or with absorb’d distracted mien</div>
<div class="verse indent1">She agitates the air,</div>
<div class="verse">With fan, whose feathers Araby</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Had sent, the choicest there.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The Cavalier was slightly form’d,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
<div class="verse indent1">And of the middle size,</div>
<div class="verse">With reddish beard, a restless mouth,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And most unquiet eyes.</div>
<div class="verse">His visage pale and dry appear’d,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Nose sharp and of a crook,</div>
<div class="verse">Noble his port, but sinister</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And terrible his look.</div>
<div class="verse">In a red mantle he was wrapp’d,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">With golden plates o’erspread,</div>
<div class="verse">And gracefully his cap was placed</div>
<div class="verse indent1">On one side on his head.</div>
<div class="verse">With measured steps, from end to end,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">He paced along the room,</div>
<div class="verse">And different passions o’er his face</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Though silent seem’d to come.</div>
<div class="verse">At times he reddens, <a href="#note40" title="See note">darting round</a></div>
<div class="verse indent1">Fierce looks, that seem to tell,</div>
<div class="verse">As flames cast forth from eyes of fire,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The very deeds of hell.</div>
<div class="verse">And now a fierce and bitter smile</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The extended lip displays,</div>
<div class="verse">Or on the gilded roof he fix’d</div>
<div class="verse indent1">A darkly lowering gaze.</div>
<div class="verse">Now hastening on his course, from head</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To foot he trembles o’er,</div>
<div class="verse">And now proceeds his noble mien</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Of calmness to restore.</div>
<div class="verse">Thus have I seen a tiger fierce,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Now tranquil, now with rage</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Revolve himself each side across,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And round his narrow cage.</div>
<div class="verse">Thus pacing o’er the carpet there</div>
<div class="verse indent1">His footsteps are not heard,</div>
<div class="verse">But soundless they, yet were distinct</div>
<div class="verse indent1">As ever that he stirr’d,</div>
<div class="verse"><a href="#note41" title="See note">The crackling of his arms and knees:</a></div>
<div class="verse indent1">In distant lands, ’tis said,</div>
<div class="verse">That with like noise has Heaven supplied,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">For man to shun in dread,</div>
<div class="verse">O, wonder rare! a serpent, named</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Thence Rattlesnake, that springs</div>
<div class="verse">Quick at the moment it comes nigh,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And kills whome’er it stings.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The Lady was Padillia,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">That sat in mournful strain;</div>

<div class="verse">As round some solitary tower,</div>

<div class="verse">Whose shadows darken as they pass</div>

<div class="verse indent1">His brother’s power and state,</div>
<div class="verse">Of those whose mother he had slain,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And birth would criminate.</div>
<div class="verse">Now of unquietnesses borne,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Great scorn and insult shown,</div>
<div class="verse">Or of his failing treasury,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Nor means to fill it known.</div>
<div class="verse">Now of the fair Aldonza’s charms,</div>

<div class="verse">Or of the blood-stain’d forms of those</div>
<div class="verse indent1">He had unjustly slain.</div>
<div class="verse">Now some projected enterprise,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Some treaty to defeat,</div>
<div class="verse">Faith-breaking with Granada’s Moor,</div>

<div class="verse indent1">Was tangled in the range,</div>
<div class="verse">At length from breast and head alike</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Fled finding a retreat,</div>

<div class="verse indent1">With horror great replete,</div>
<div class="verse">The image of Fadrique,</div>

<div class="verse">The pride of knights and Master those</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now from Humillia’s conquer’d walls,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">With matchless courage won,</div>

<div class="verse">The Lady Blanche, but he allow’d</div>
<div class="verse indent1">A year to intervene.</div>

<div class="verse indent1">And rumours thus of those,</div>
<div class="verse">Which whether true or false alike</div>

<div class="verse">And in Medina’s tower the price</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The Lady Blanche now pays,</div>

<div class="verse">Unhappy victim lives of fears,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">That ever her attend,</div>
<div class="verse">Because she loves the king, and sees</div>
<div class="verse indent1">His course in evil end:</div>
<div class="verse">She knows that based in blood and grief,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And persecution’s train,</div>
<div class="verse">A palace never is secure,</div>

<div class="verse">At length, though with a trembling lip,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The silence breaking dared</div>
<div class="verse">To speak, and thus the words that pass’d</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Between the two declared:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
<div class="verse">“Your brother then, Fadrique,</div>

<div class="verse">“He serves you well, and hero-like,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">As does Humillia show,</div>
<div class="verse">Of loyalty gives proofs, and brave</div>
<div class="verse indent1">He is”&mdash;“Sufficient so.”</div>
<div class="verse">“You may be sure, Sire, that his heart</div>

<span class="smaller">MANUEL BRETON DE LOS HERREROS.</span></h3>

<p>In the country of Lope de Vega and Calderon de la Barca,
it was not to be supposed, that on the general revival of the
national literature, the drama could be left neglected, in a
state unworthy of its ancient reputation. From the time of
those great writers until the present, notwithstanding the
predilection of the Spanish people for the stage, and the encouragement
consequently given for genius to exert itself, no
dramas had been produced to equal them in the public admiration.
The younger Moratin, who may be justly termed
the Spanish Molière, had rather introduced into Spain a new
style of drama, that which we call genteel comedy, than followed
the track of the ancient masters. It was reserved for
a later writer, the subject of this notice, to appear as a rival
to them in the exuberance of composition, and possession of
popular favour, though it may be a question for future ages
to decide on his relative merit.</p>

<p>Breton de los Herreros was born at Quel, a small village
in the province of Logronio, the 19th December, 1796. Of
his early history, we are only informed that he was educated
at the school of San Antonio Abad at Madrid, and that he
entered a regiment of infantry as a volunteer, when yet a boy
of fourteen. The world at large may be considered to be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
with regard to contemporary characters of another nation, in
the relation of posterity, making distance have, as Bishop Atterbury
remarked to Lord Bolingbroke, the effect of time;
and they will thus inquire eagerly into the particulars of the
life of one distinguished for genius, however humble his birth,
while they will pass heedlessly by the noblest born personage,
who has given them no peculiar right of interest in his history.
But, as on reading the life of the Duke de Rivas, we feel it
a subject of congratulation, that the lance of a French marauder
did not cut off one who was destined to be the ornament
of his country’s literature, so we rejoice again equally
that the chance passed away favourably, when a stray ball
might have deprived the world of the works of Breton de los
Herreros. Serving in his humble line, he was present at
various skirmishes with the invaders on their final expulsion
from Valencia and Catalonia, at the same time composing
patriotic songs on the national triumphs. In 1812, when
yet a boy of fifteen, he wrote an Ode to the Constitution,
and distinguished himself as an orator among his comrades
on the popular subjects of discussion. On the return of
Ferdinand VII. to absolute power, he must have been compelled
to restrain his tendencies for liberalism, and it may be
supposed that his time was at least as well employed in noting
the characters of those around him, and the scenes he had to
witness, as a storehouse of useful observations for his future
writings.</p>

<p>In 1822 he obtained his discharge from the army, and
after various attempts made to obtain an eligible employment
in the provinces, he went to Madrid, in the summer of 1824,
for the same purpose. There again he was equally unsuccessful,
and as a last resource, took to the director of the
theatre, a comedy which he had written some years previously
for pastime. Fortunately for him, the director happ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>ened to
be in want of a new piece to bring out on the king’s birthday,
and thinking the one presented would answer his purpose,
he undertook its production with more than usual care,
on account of the occasion. It was accordingly performed on
the 24th October, 1824, and met with such decided success,
that the literary fame of the author was at once secured.</p>

<p>The profits accruing from the representation of his comedies
were exceedingly trifling; but his natural inclinations
led him to writing for the stage, where he now found
himself respected as a successful writer; and as he had
no other resource for maintenance, he applied himself to
this labour with better hopes. A succession of pieces he
wrote were equally successful, produced with a rapidity that
reminded the world of the fertility that had characterized
the genius of Lope de Vega or Calderon. One of his
pieces was so much relished, that at the close, the audience
insisted on its being repeated all over a second time, with
which extraordinary demand the actors had to comply. In
1831 he brought out his comedy of ‘Marcela, or Which of the
Three?’&mdash;the most popular of all his productions, the subject
being, which of three lovers, all unworthy of her, the heroine,
who is amiability personified, should accept. It was repeated
at all the theatres in the kingdom, and went through six
editions on publication, besides several surreptitious ones,
having some of the verses even passing into “household
words,” as popular expressions.</p>

<p>In the same year, 1831, he published a small volume of
poems, containing lyrical and miscellaneous pieces, and has
since written many more of the same character in the different
periodicals of Madrid. None of these are, however, deserving
of note, except the satirical ones, many of which abound with
the wit and humour for which his comedies are remarkable.
He is now engaged in publishing at Madrid a collection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
all his works, the last volume being intended to contain the
miscellaneous poems, which, corrected and collected together
from the different papers in which they at first appeared, will
no doubt prove to be more worthy of his fame than those
published in 1831. In the lyrical poems he is avowedly a
follower of the so-called classical school, and rises no higher
than those of the same class that had preceded him; their
utmost praise being to be characterized as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Coldly correct and classically dull.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the satirical pieces, however, he seems in his proper
element, playing on words and treating his rhymes with a
command of language truly surprising. For this reason, and
on account of the numerous local and national allusions contained
in them, it is very difficult for a foreigner fully to
understand, and almost impossible to be able to translate
them. Those pieces attempted in this work may perhaps
give some faint image of his style; but they have been chosen
as most easy for translation, rather than as the best. Of the
Satires published separately after the volume above mentioned,
the most applauded have been those entitled, ‘Against
the Philharmonic Rage;’ ‘Against the Mania for Writing for
the Public;’ ‘Against the Abuses introduced into Theatrical
Declamation;’ ‘Moral Epistle on the Manners of the Age;’
and ‘The Rage for Travelling.’ With the Spaniards of the
present day as with their Roman ancestors, satire is a
favourite species of composition, and it has been observed,
that a manual of the history of the national dissensions
might be composed out of the works of this popular author
alone.</p>

<p>Breton, independently of his original writings, has had the
editorship of one of the periodicals of Madrid, and occasional
engagements connected with others. He also had at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
time an appointment in one of the offices of the government,
which he seems to have lost in 1840, on his writing some
satirical effusion on the change that had then taken place.
Literature has been in every age a grievous exaction, for
those who had to follow it as a profession, except under
peculiar circumstances. He had only his genius to befriend
him, and apparently had not even the virtue of prudence for
a counsellor. Thus he has had often to submit to circumstances,
which though harassing at the time, he had the
wisdom to make subjects of merriment afterwards, to the
gain of his literary reputation.</p>

<p>In Spain there can scarcely yet be said to be formed a
“reading public,” notwithstanding the great number of
good works that have been lately published, to supply the
demand whenever it shall arise. The most evident and
flattering of all the applauses that a literary man can there
receive, are those awarded to dramatic successes, and of these,
he has had the reward that was certainly due to him. In
such a climate as that of Spain, and with such a people,
theatrical amusements are more a matter of popular necessity
than they are in a colder climate, with people of more domestic
requirements; and yet even in England it may be a
cause of surprise, considering the honour given to the author
of a successful play, that more works of genius have not been
produced for the stage. In both countries there is a complaint
of the public requiring “novelties;” but the fact is,
that in seeking novelties, they are only seeking excellence.
When any really good work is presented them, they know
how to appreciate it, and in seeking for others even of the
same author, they are only expressing their sense of his
merits.</p>

<p>In the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>prospectus of the proposed new edition of his works,
he had the satisfaction of stating he had to republish more
than sixty original dramas, that had met with a successful
reception from the audiences of Madrid. He has besides
these produced several that have not been successful, and has
translated from the French a great number of others. These
have been principally tragedies, and he has adapted them for
the Spanish stage, rather than translated them, showing a
talent, it has been observed by Del Rio, in so doing equivalent
to making them to be counted in the number of his original
works. Del Rio cites as a particular example, the translation
from Delavigne’s Tragedy of ‘The Sons of Edward.’
Breton’s talent is evidently pre-eminent for comedy; but he
has written several tragedies also, of which one, the ‘Merope,’
brought forward in 1835, was received with much favour.</p>

<p>This work, as it has been more than once already intimated,
is intended mainly to give an account of the lyrical poetry of
Spain as nourishing at present; and, therefore, it would be
entering on subjects foreign to our purpose, to inquire at large
into the merits of any specific dramatic performances. The
Spanish drama may, no doubt, be worthy of especial study,
but I confess that I have not felt it deserving of the extravagant
praises which some writers have bestowed on it. It would
surely be much happier for the people of every country to
seek their greatest enjoyments in those of a domestic nature,
rather than in those miscellaneous congregations where the
quieter virtues can have little exercise. But as human nature
is constituted, and public amusements cannot be avoided, it
is the duty of every friend of the popular interests to support
their being given on the foundation of good taste and moral
principles. Though Breton’s works do not appear free from
all blame in this respect, and though sometimes his witticisms
may be observed scarcely fitting even for the stage,
yet they show, on the whole, compared with the dramatic
productions of other countries, at least equal refin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>ement, as
they certainly do more inventive talent than we can point
out elsewhere in our age.</p>

<p>Larra, the most discriminating critic of Spain, has observed
of Breton, “that in nothing does his peculiar poetical talent
shine more than in the simplicity of his plans. In all his
comedies it is known that he makes a study and show of
forming a plot extremely simple,&mdash;little or no action, little or
no artifice. This is conceded to talent only, and to superior
talent. A comedy, full of incidents, which any one invents,
is easy to be passed off on a public always captivated by what
interests and excites curiosity. Breton despises these trivial
resources, and sustains and carries to a happy conclusion,
amid the continual laughter of the audience, and from applause
to applause, a comedy based principally on the
depicting of some comic characters, in the liveliness and
quickness of repartee, in the pureness, flow and harmony of
his easy versification. In these gifts he has no rival, though
he may have them in regard to intention, profoundness or
philosophy.”</p>

<p>Ferrer del Rio says of him, “that he has cultivated a style
so much his own, that at the first few verses of one of his
works, the spectators cry out his name from all parts. Originality
is thus one of the qualities that recommend him.
He tyrannizes over the public, obliging them to cast away
ill-humour, and laugh against their will from the time the
curtain rises till the representation ends, and this the same
whether in the comedies they applaud, or those they disapprove.
He is consequently mirthful and witty in the extreme,
and no one can dispute the palm with him under this
consideration. None of his scenes fatigue from weariness;
none of his verses fail of fullness and harmony; they do not
appear made one after another, but at one blow, and as by
enchantment. Thus all hail him as a perfect versifier and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
easy colloquist. Infinite are the matters he has introduced
in his comedies, multiplied the characters sketched by his
pen, innumerable the situations imagined, and undoubtedly
there is due to him the well-founded ascription of a fertile
genius. Originality, wit, easy dialogue, sonorous versification,
an inexhaustible vein, would not be sufficient to form a
good comic writer of manners without the criterion of observation,
fit for filling up his pictures with exactness. This
criterion also he possesses in a high degree.”</p>

<p>High as is this encomium, the writer says of him further,
that if it were decreed by Providence that a new race of barbarians
should overrun Spain, destroying libraries and other
depositaries of human knowledge, yet the name of Breton de
los Herreros would survive the disaster, and some vestige of
his comedies would remain. “Histories, books of learning,
works of legislation, science, philosophy and politics are, no
doubt, more profound than his comedies, though from their
peculiar nature not so popular. Thus what we have said is
to be understood as a means of distinguishing between
writings which, that they may not perish in the course of
ages, require studious men to adopt them for a test, and
learned men to illustrate them by their commentaries, and
those compositions that, to succeed in obtaining the honours
of immortality, require only a people to recite and transmit
them verbally from father to son. The name of Breton may
become traditional in Spain, that of other celebrated writers
will belong to history.”</p>

<p>Breton has been elected a member of the Royal Spanish
Academy, and certainly one so highly gifted as he is in his
department, is well deserving of every literary honour. The
times are gone by when a writer of comedies could be all in
all with the public as their favourite author; but probably
there is no other existing in Spain who enjoys so much popu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>lar
regard. As such, notwithstanding the inferior merit
of his lyrical and miscellaneous poetry, excepting his satirical
writings, it would have been a blameworthy omission to have
left his name out of the list of the modern poets of Spain.
It was, however, for this reason more advisable to make the
selections from those satirical writings; though independently
of this consideration, it would have been also desirable, in a
work attempting to give a general view of modern Spanish
poetry, that so essential and popular a branch of it should
not be left unnoticed.</p>

<p>For the poems under this head, Breton has only given the
general term “Satirical Letrillias,” so that with those translated
his numbering only could be adopted for reference.
The Letrillia, it may be proper to observe, is what our musical
writers call Motetts or small pieces, having generally
some well-known proverbial saying for the close of each verse.</p>

<span class="smaller">JOSÈ MARIA HEREDIA.</span></h3>

<p>The people of Cuba have good cause to be proud of a poet
born in their island, whose genius seems always to have found
its highest inspiration in expatiating on the charms of the
place of his birth.</p>

<p>Heredia was born the 31st December, 1803, at Santiago
de Cuba, in which city his family had taken refuge when
driven away by the revolution from the island of Santo Domingo,
where they had been previously settled. His father,
whose profession was that of the law, was shortly afterwards
appointed a Judge in Mexico, where he accordingly went
with his family, taking his son there for his education under
his special superintendence. This duty he had the privilege
allowed him to accomplish, when he died in 1820, leaving a
reputation for ability and uprightness so eminent as to prove
highly advantageous to his son in his subsequent necessities.
On his father’s death, Heredia returned with his mother and
three sisters to Cuba, where he had an uncle and other relations
residing, and there he engaged in a course of study for
the profession of the law, at the termination of which he was,
in 1823, admitted an Advocate in the Supreme Court of t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>he
island. From his earliest years he had always shown himself
possessed of a very studious disposition, and some of his poems
seem to have been written when only eighteen years of age.</p>

<p>In the pursuit of the profession he had adopted, with his
talent and energy, Heredia might have hoped soon to acquire
a very honourable position; but unfortunately for his future
comfort in life, he had imbibed too strongly the principles
then prevailing to consider the domination of Spain as an
evil which ought to be removed. It is stated, that there was
a conspiracy even then formed to declare the independence of
the island, in which he was implicated; and that on his being
denounced to the government in consequence, he was obliged
to fly from the island. Proceedings under this charge were
notwithstanding instituted against him, under which he was
formally declared banished. He thereupon went, in November
1823, to New York, where he passed the following three
years, appearing, from the accounts that reached his friends,
to have lived there during that time in great privations.
These, and the variableness of the climate, operating severely
on his constitution, as a native of the tropics, were no doubt
the causes of his becoming a victim to that fatal disease which
terminated his existence a few years afterwards.</p>

<p>In New York he acquired soon an accurate knowledge of
the English language, which enabled him also to become
familiarly acquainted with English literature. Of this he
showed no inconsiderable tokens, in a volume of poems which
he published there in 1825, having included among them
several translations from the English, though he has not acknowledged
them generally as such. He continued the same
neglect in the edition of his works published subsequently in
Mexico in 1832, which was a much superior edition to the
former, being more than doubled in regard to its contents,
and having the poems formerly published now much correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>ed
and improved.</p>

<p>Not finding his residence in New York offering him any
hopes of advancement in life, and despairing of being able to
return to his family in Cuba, he determined to go thence to
Mexico and seek the assistance of his father’s friends in that
city. He accordingly went there in 1826, and had scarcely
arrived when he was at once appointed to a situation in the
office of the Secretary of State. From this minor post he was
soon afterwards promoted to discharge various important
offices in the provinces, and finally to be named one of the
Judges of the Supreme Court of Mexico and a Senator of the
Republic. It was while holding one of those appointments
as a local judge at Toluca that he published there the second
edition of his works just mentioned.</p>

<p>After the death of Ferdinand VII., in 1833, the Regent,
Queen Christina, wisely accorded a general amnesty to all
expatriated Spaniards, when Heredia, notwithstanding the
favourable position he held in Mexico, where also he had
married in 1827, wished to take advantage of it to return to
his family. On making application, however, for permission
to do so, he was refused it by the Captain-General of Cuba,
and all he could obtain was permission to go there for two
months to visit his aged mother and other relatives, subject
to the observation of the police. He went there accordingly
in 1836, when, by a singular coincidence, he joined his family
again on the same day of the month that thirteen years before
he had parted from them.</p>

<p>On his arrival in Cuba, he was subjected to some of those
petty annoyances which military governments too often impose
on people under their sway. A friend of his who had
gone to meet him, found him, notwithstanding his rank in
the Mexican republic, or his reputation as a literary character,
or his evident state of ill-health, seated on a bench in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span> the
court of the government office, to wait his turn at the pleasure
of the official, who thought he was showing his dignity by
exposing to unnecessary delay those whom he had to note
under his inspection. Heredia was so altered that his friend
could scarcely recognize him, and his relatives soon had to
become apprehensive that his health was seriously endangered.
He had given the most solemn assurance to the authorities
that he would not in any way during his visit interfere in the
public questions of the day, and he fulfilled his promise. If
he really had entered in his youth into any plot against the
government, the most dangerous conspirator in it could
scarcely have been a young man of nineteen, who seems to
have been the principal sufferer. But in any case, he had by
time and reflection become very altered in sentiment, and his
failing strength would not admit of any extraordinary exertion,
even if he had remained the same enthusiast for political
liberty as he was in his youth. He would have wished to
stay the remainder of his life with his family, but it was his
duty to return to Mexico after the expiration of the period
allowed him, and there he died of consumption on his return,
the 6th May, 1839. After his death, his widow and her children
came to Cuba, where she died the 16th June, 1844,
leaving a son and two daughters in the kindly charge of his
relatives.</p>

<p>The Toluca edition of Heredia’s poems in two volumes,
1832, does great credit to the Mexican press, being one of
the best printed Spanish works to be found. But it is extremely
scarce, and therefore deserves a more detailed account
of it than might be requisite with works better known. In
addition to those contained in the first edition, which is yet
comparatively frequently to be met with, it contains his philosophic
and patriotic poems, some of which are very spirited,
and one, the ‘Hymn of the Banished,’ an extremely fine one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
The copies of the work sent to Havana had these patriotic
poems taken out, as otherwise they would have been seized
by the authorities; so that most of the copies of the work existing
are deficient with regard to them. In the place of the
odes thus taken out, another poem, ‘On Immortality,’ was
inserted, which, however, is principally taken from the Seventh
Book of Young’s Night Thoughts, though not so stated. The
other principal poems, in respect of length, are, ‘On the Worth
of Women,’ and ‘the Pleasures of Melancholy.’ Of another
very fine ode, ‘To Niagara,’ a very excellent translation into
English blank verse has appeared in the United States Review.</p>

<p>In the preface to the second edition, he states that he had
been induced to undertake it, upon finding that several of
the poems in the first had been reprinted in Paris, London,
Hamburg and Philadelphia, and had been received with
much favour in his own country, where <a href="#note45" title="See note">the celebrated Lista</a>
had pronounced him “a great poet.” There can be no
doubt that other editions would have met with very favourable
reception, had it not been for the circumstance of his
being considered an author obnoxious to the Spanish government.
As it is, the Creoles of Cuba have manuscript copies
of his poems circulating amongst themselves, generally faulty
as dependent on the taste of the individuals who had copied
them. The effect of this is apparent in the only edition I
am aware of, that has been published in Spain, that of Barcelona,
in 1840, acknowledged to be taken from a manuscript
copy, in which not only are some of his best compositions
omitted, such as the ‘Lines to his Horse,’ and the poem
entitled, ‘The Season of the Northers,’ but some others,
for instance, the ‘Ode to the Sun,’ are given imperfectly. In
return, it gives a poem on receiving the portrait of his
mother, which had not appeared in the former editions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
which is not unworthy of being compared with Cowper’s on
the same subject, though treated differently.</p>

<p>In the prologue to this edition the editor observes, that
“in all his productions is seen an excellency of heart and an
imagination truly poetical, enabling us to assert with Lista
that he is a great poet, and one of the best of our day.” He
adds, “the poems of Heredia have, in our judgement, the
merit of a purity of language, which unfortunately begins to
be unknown in Spain. They are of a kind equally apart
from the monotony and servileness, ascribed perhaps with
reason to the classicists, and from the extravagant aberration
of those who affect to be called Romanticists, and believe
they are so, because they despise all rules in their compositions,
substituting words and phrases unknown to our better
writers and poets.”</p>

<p>The language of Heredia in his poems is by the concurrent
opinion of all Spanish critics very pure, and even
strangers can feel its simplicity and nature in connexion
with the truly poetical thoughts they contain, free from all
conceits or affectations. In his best original compositions,
the sentiments expressed are generally of a tender and melancholy
character, as might be expected from his history, of
one banished from his country and family, while suffering
from privations and ill-health, and at length sinking under
a fatal disease. Like many other poets, he thus also writes
most affectingly when dwelling on his own personal feelings,
as if to verify the declaration of Shelley, that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent9">… most men</div>
<div class="verse">Are cradled into poetry by wrong;</div>
<div class="verse">They learn in suffering what they teach in song.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The ‘Lines to his Horse’ and ‘The Season of the
Northers’ bear intrinsic evidence of their origin, and also
the Ode entitled ‘Poesy.’ This one bears a stro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>ng resemblance
in its general tone to the ‘Epistle to His Brother’
and the poem of ‘Sleep and Poetry’ by Keats, whose character
and fate also were in some degree the same as his.
They have the same sentiment, as conscious of fame awaiting
them, common to all poets, but peculiarly to those of
more sensitive temperament, the ‘non omnis moriar,’ the hope
of immortality,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Ἐλπίδ’ ἔχω κλέος εὑρέσθαι</div>
<div class="verse indent1">κεν ὑψηλὸν πρόσω.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If the extravagant eulogiums bestowed on the merit of the
Sonnet, as a form of verse, by some Italian writers, and
echoed by Boileau and others, be at all deserved, Heredia’s
claims to superiority may be put forward very confidently, in
respect of that to ‘His Wife’ in dedication of the second
edition of his works. It contains all the conditions required
for a perfect composition of this kind, in the poetical statement
of the subject, the application of it, the beautiful simile
given as a counterpart, and the strikingly appropriate idea
with which it closes. Of this idea, the classical reader will
at once perceive the elegance and force; but he cannot do
so fully, unless he have also seen in the churches of seaport
towns on the continent, as for instance, that of Santa Maria
del Socorro, at Cadiz, the votive offerings of gratitude for
deliverances from danger.</p>

<p>The ‘Ode to Night’ might have been considered worthy
of equally unqualified commendation, were it not for the
circumstance that <a href="#note46" title="See note">twelve out of the nineteen stanzas</a> it contains
are almost a paraphrase from the Italian of Ippolito
Pindemonte. At the time of making the translation hereafter
given, I had not read that very pleasing writer, but
have since found the source of the poem in his ‘Poesie Campestri,
Le quattro parti del giorno,’ to which, therefore,
justice requires the acknowledgement to be given. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
much to be regretted that Heredia did not distinguish his
original compositions in all cases from imitations, as there is
no statement with regard to this one, of its having been taken
from another author. There are other instances of the same
neglect, as in a close translation from Campbell of ‘The Ode
to the Rainbow,’ equally unacknowledged. The interests of
literature require that such acknowledgements should be
uniformly made, that we should know gold from imitations,
and give every one his right and place. As the same Italian
poet remarked in his ‘Opinioni Politiche,’</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Conosco anch’io negli ordini civili</div>
<div class="verse">L’oro dal fango, ed anch’io veggio che altra</div>
<div class="verse">Cosa è il nascere Inglese, ed altra Turco.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Heredia’s original poems, many of them written to, or
respecting his near relatives or other friends, betoken so
much true poetic feeling, as well as flow of poetical ideas,
that we cannot suppose the neglect of which we have complained
to have been more than an oversight. He might
even in some cases have lost remembrance of his obligations,
and repeated from memory when he thought he was writing
from inspiration. The latter <a href="#note47" title="See note">part of his first volume is entirely
taken up with “Imitations;”</a> but those we have noticed
above are in the second volume, without any distinction from
the original poems.</p>

<p>He had, however, in early life so many privations to endure,
and so many daily necessities for which to make a
daily provision, that we may not be surprised at his inexactness
in minor matters. In the preface to the second edition,
he says, that “the revolutionary whirlwind had made him
traverse over a vast course in a short time, and that with
better or worse fortune he had been an advocate, a soldier, a
traveller, a teacher of languages, a diplomatist, a journalist,
a judge, a writer of history, and a poet at twenty-five years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of age. All my writings,” he observes, “must partake of
the variableness of my lot. The new generation will enjoy
serener days, and those who then dedicate themselves to the
Muses will be much more happy.” On his first going to
Mexico, it is to be supposed that he had to enter on military
duties in the unsettled state of the country, and that he had
some diplomatic commissions entrusted to him by the government,
of which, however, we have no other account.
This, in fact, may be said to be the first biographical notice
of him published, obtained from information given by his
relatives, who, having been long separated from him, could
not explain the particular references more fully.</p>

<p>As a writer of history, he had published, also in Mexico, a
work in four volumes, 8vo. which was chiefly a compilation
from Tytler, but with additions in Spanish and Mexican
history, suited to the community, for whose benefit it was
intended. In this respect, as in so many other parts of his
career, the knowledge he had acquired of the English language
was of essential assistance to him, while it was no
less evident that his knowledge of English literature had improved
his taste and strengthened his powers of mind also in
his own compositions.</p>

<p>In private life Heredia appears to have been a most amiable
character: courteous, generous, and possessed of the most lively
sensibility, he made himself beloved by all who had to enter
into communication with him. He was also remarkable for
the exceeding great ingenuousness of his disposition, which,
while it rendered him incapable of vanity in himself, made
him at the same time as incapable of dwelling on the faults
of others. Several of his poems show further a religious

equanimity the various trials to which he had been subjected.</p>

<p>Those trials it seemed were appointed to attend him further,
even if it had pleased the Almighty to prolong his existence.
Shortly before his death, the Mexican legislature
passed a law declaring that no one should hold any office
under the republic who was not a natural born citizen; and
thus he was, among others, deprived of the offices he had
held with credit to himself and advantage to the state. If
the measure were directed against him personally, it was of
short operation, and political intrigues could not avail to deprive
him of the consciousness of having fulfilled his duties
honourably, or of the claim he had to leave on the remembrance
of future ages.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">When yet was burning in my fervid veins</div>

<div class="verse">But sweeter to my fiery soul ’tis far</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To feel myself whirl’d forward in the train</div>
<div class="verse">Of thy wild torrent, and as with a star</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The brow deck’d proudly, hear thy oracles</div>
<div class="verse">Divine; and to repeat them, as of old</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Greece listen’d mute to those from Delphic cells</div>

<div class="verse">Of the great fount of light whence first they flow’d;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And then, in spite of envy, o’er their tomb</div>
<div class="verse">A sterile laurel buds, ay, buds and grows,</div>

<span class="smaller">JOSÈ DE ESPRONCEDA.</span></h3>

<p>In the introductory part of this work, while acknowledging
the merits of the earlier poets of Spain, it may be remembered
that a claim was made in favour of the still superior excellences
of their successors in the present day. If the reader,
who has followed us so far through these notices, has not
already come to the same conclusion, his assent may be confidently
expected to the assertion, in consideration of the surpassingly
poetical genius of the two writers who have now to
come under his review.</p>

<p>In considering the merits of their earlier poets, the best
critics of Spain have not been so blinded by national partiality
as to be led into awarding them unqualified commendations.
In the very able prologue to the ‘Moro Esposito’ of the Duke
de Rivas, said to have been written by the celebrated Alcalà
Galiano, we find an estimation of them which we can adopt,
as correct in judgement as it is unexceptionable for an authority.
He says, “Though the tenderness of Garcilasso, the
warmth of Herrera, the fancy, at once lively and thoughtful,
of Rioja, and, above all, those strong feelings of devotion
which give to Fray Luis de Leon a character so original, even
when he is most an imitator, are sources of great perfections,
and most glorious crowns of the Spanish Parnassus, yet we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
are obliged to confess, that in the Spanish poets, lyric and
pastoral, we see too great a sameness, that their stock of ideas
and images is limited and common to them all, and that if
varied and choice in expression, they are uniform in their
arguments and plans, founding their merit more in the gala
and pomp of language, in the floridness and sonorousness of
verse, and in the ingenious dexterity of making variations
on one theme, than in the vigour and originality of their
thoughts, or in the strength and profoundness of the emotions
which they felt, or which their works excite in the
minds of their readers.”</p>

<p>Entirely coinciding in the opinions thus expressed, we feel,
on the other hand, with regard to the modern Spanish poets,
that while they have fully maintained the grace and beauty
that distinguished their predecessors in former ages, their
genius has expanded over far wider fields, and embraced subjects
of as varied and powerful interest as the contemporary
poetry of any other country can present to delight or captivate.
As instances in support of this opinion, we have, in
particular, to refer to the comparatively few but exceedingly
brilliant compositions of Espronceda, whose early loss, at only
thirty-two years of age, the whole literary world has to deplore.</p>

<p>We have great cause to be thankful to Ferrer del Rio that
we have any account at all of this very eminent lyric poet,
though the one he has given is far from being so full as the
admirers of his genius might have desired. From that account,
we learn that it was in the spring of 1810, during the
most momentous period of the war of independence, a colonel
of cavalry, after some long and harassing marches, was obliged
to halt at the small town of Almendralejo, in the province of
Estremadura, in the face of the enemy, on account of his wife,
who had followed him through the campaigns, having there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
had a son born, the subject of this narrative. We have no
other particulars of his earlier years, than that on the conclusion
of the war his parents settled at Madrid, where he was
placed at an early age under the tuition of Lista, a writer
who enjoyed considerable reputation at the time as a poet,
but whose chief merit consisted in his critical and elementary
works. Under such a preceptor, his natural genius found a
congenial course of tuition, and verse-making seems to have
been a part of his usual studies. It was remarked, that
though he was by no means inclined to steady application,
yet, that by the force of his quick comprehension, he shone
as prominently as others of greater industry, and when a
mere boy produced verses which gave tokens of future eminence.</p>

<p>When only fourteen years of age he joined a society of
youths who called themselves Numantines, and was elected
one of their tribunes. In their meetings, no doubt, there was
much intended treason debated, for which, whether deservedly
or not, the government of the day thought proper to proceed
against them at law, and Espronceda, with others, was sentenced
to three months’ imprisonment in the convent of Guadalajera,
in which town his father then resided. There, in
the solitude of his imprisonment, his active mind found employment
in poetry, and he was bold enough to begin an epic
poem on the subject of the national hero, Pelayo. Of this
poem there are fragments given among his works, from which
we may judge favourably of what it might have proved when
completed, containing as it does many striking passages. The
representation of Hunger, and the Dream of the King, Don
Roderic, are bold conceptions, and if they were not the additions
of after-years, were truly remarkable as the productions
of any one at so early an age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>On his release from the convent he returned to Madrid,
but feeling himself under restraint as subject to the observation
of the police, and desirous also of visiting other countries,
he shortly afterwards went to Gibraltar and thence to Lisbon.
There he seems to have been subjected to great privations,
which, however, did not prevent his being involved in romantic
adventures, characteristic of one of his temperament,
such as he subsequently described with all the warmth of
poetic feeling. But the ministers of the king, now restored
to absolute power by French intervention, could not allow
Spanish emigrants to be congregated so near to Spain, and at
their instance Espronceda and others were obliged to go from
Lisbon to London. How he maintained himself, during these
wanderings, we are not informed, but his relatives probably
had the means to afford him sufficient for his pressing necessities,
and the love of adventure would lead him, oftentimes
willingly, into situations from which most others would have
recoiled.</p>

<p>In London, we are informed, that he enjoyed the happiest
period of his life, though not abounding in resources; passing
his time between his studies and gaieties, which resulted in
confirmed dissipation. He learned to read Shakespeare and
Milton, as well as Byron, and considering his inclinations, his
habits and his writings, we need not be surprised to find him
supposed to have taken the last for his model. There he
began the series of compositions which place him in the first
rank of lyric poets, though we have to lament that they are
tinctured with a spirit of such evil character. His ‘Elegy to
Spain,’ dated London, 1829, is in the original written with
peculiar sweetness of expression, which Del Rio finds in the
style of the Prophet of the Lamentations, and which, though
not so well suited for translation as most of his other poem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>s,
has been chosen as the effusion of the patriotic muse of Spain,
no less worthy of note than others of more general application.</p>

<p>From London he passed over to Paris, and happening to be
there during the three memorable days of July 1830, he took
part in the fearful scenes which then took place with all the
ardour of his character as well as of youth. He joined afterwards
the small band of emigrants who crossed the Pyrenees
in the hopeless attempt of subverting the despotic sway that
then prevailed, resulting in the death of Don Joaquin de Pablo,
whom his friends regarded as falling heroically, and to whose
memory Espronceda has left a poem of great beauty. Returning
to Paris, he entered himself in the rank of the bold
spirits who volunteered to lend their aid in the regeneration
of Poland, from which, and other similar schemes, he was
rescued by the promulgation of the first amnesty, of which
he took advantage immediately to return to Spain.</p>

<p>On his arrival in Madrid, he entered himself in the Royal
Guard, where he soon won the goodwill and affections of his
officers and comrades, and might have risen to distinction,
but for an unfortunate though characteristic occurrence. He
had written some verses on passing events connected with the
service, which were recited at a banquet, and having been
much applauded and passed from hand to hand, came to the
knowledge of the ministry, who thereupon, notwithstanding
the efforts of his colonel to the contrary, dismissed Espronceda
from the corps, and banished him to the town of Cuellar.
There he composed a work, which he called a novel, under the
title of the ‘Sancho of Saldania,’ but which, though containing
some good sketches and descriptions, is only worthy of
notice as having been one of his compositions.</p>

<p>“On the dawning of liberty in Spain with the p<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>romulgation
of the Estatuto,” by Martinez de la Rosa, he came forward
as a journalist, connected with the paper published as
‘The Age.’ His proud spirit could not submit to the censorship
previously existing, but even now he had to feel its influence.
The fourteenth number of his paper, the most violent
of the time, was found to contain some articles which
were forbidden by the censor, and as the time pressed, the
editors did not know how to supply the deficiency. The
ready genius of Espronceda suggested a scheme, which, after
a little hesitation, was adopted: this was to publish the sheet
in blank, with merely the headings, which had not been
struck out of the manuscript by the censor. Accordingly,
the usual sheet appeared with the titles only of the subjects
it had originally to bear, namely&mdash;“The Amnesty;” “Domestic
Policy;” “Letter from Don Miguel and Don Manuel
Bravedeed in defence of their honour and patriotism;” “On
the Cortes;” “Song on the Death of Don Joaquin de
Pablo.” The effect was startling, and perhaps more powerful
than the forbidden articles would have proved. The
people supplied the deficiencies according to their individual
feelings, and the ingenuity of the device had its fullest success.
As the result, the publication of the paper was forbidden,
and the managers had to hide themselves for a time to
escape further prosecution.</p>

<p>In the years 1835 and 1836, there were several serious
commotions in Madrid in which he joined, erecting barricades
in the principal square, and making violent harangues
to the people. On both occasions the disturbances were soon
put down by the military, and he had to hide himself in the
provinces, until, in the year 1840, Espartero having put himself
at the head of the liberal party, the public principles prevailed
for which Espronceda had so exerted himself. He
then came forth again from his retirement, and made himself
conspicuous by appearing as an advocate in a ca<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>se in which
a paper named the ‘Hurricane’ had been denounced at law
for a seditious article it contained. Espronceda’s speech in
defence, from some passages of it given by Del Rio, appears
to have been very energetic, and as inflammatory as the
article accused, but he was successful, and the proprietor of
the paper was acquitted.</p>

<p>In the same year, 1840, he published the volume of poems
on which his fame rests, as perhaps the first lyric poet that
Spain has produced. Most of the contents had been previously
given in the periodical publications of Madrid, but it
was a great service to literature to have them collected. They
contained the fragment of the epic poem, ‘Pelayo,’ and a
short dramatic piece, entitled, ‘The Student of Salamanca,’
in which his own character is supposed to have been depicted;
as well as the lyric odes and other poems. They are comparatively
few in number, not exceeding fifteen altogether, but
of such rare excellence as to make us regret that so gifted a
writer was to be so soon cut off, depriving the literary world
of the hopes of still further excellence they gave reason to
expect. In the following year, 1841, he published his poem,
‘The Devil World, El Diablo Mundo,’ in four cantos, to
which three others were afterwards added, found among his
papers after his death. His friends had long feared that he
was not destined to attain a prolonged period of life, but their
fears were unhappily realized much sooner than they had
imagined.</p>

<p>In December 1841, Espronceda was sent to the Hague
as Secretary of Legation, but the coldness of the climate
affecting too severely his enfeebled constitution, he was
obliged, almost immediately, to return to Spain. He had
meanwhile been elected Deputy to the Cortes for Almeria,
and he attempted to take accordingly his share of public
duties. But his health and strength had been undermined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
by the life of hazard, of privations and excesses he had undergone,
and the journey to the Hague in the depth of winter
seemed to give the final shock to his frame, from which
it could not recover. On the 23rd of May, 1842, his friends
and admirers were thrown into unexpected grief by hearing
that he had died that morning, after what was termed a four
days’ illness. The immediate cause was said to have been
some disorder affecting the throat, and his sufferings have
been described by an intimate friend and schoolfellow, who
was with him at the time, as very painful. The loss to Spain
and the whole literary world was as great as it was irreparable;
and so the people seemed to feel it, by the general expression
of regret over his fate, such as it seldom falls to the lot of any
one to excite.</p>

<p>The moralist might dilate on the evil courses which probably
hastened his death, and all must lament that a man
of such extraordinary genius should have sunk under them;
but before we judge any one severely, we should be certain of
being able to form a right judgement. The utmost remark,
therefore, we permit ourselves to make, may be to consider
his history as a lesson to all under similar circumstances of
life, that if they will not take heed to a moral in others, they
may become a warning themselves. Every man’s character
may be taken as a whole, in which his good and evil qualities
are often so blended together as to make them inseparable.
The excesses of youth are often “the flash and outbreak of a
fiery mind,” which shows itself in its true characters in other
respects, though often with the alloy of lower passions to
lead them to a fatal end. Thus Byron and Espronceda, two
kindred geniuses in our days, have sunk prematurely into the
grave, most unhappily, when new fields of glory seemed to
be opened before them to retrieve the past errors of life, and
make it in future as honourable as they had already rende<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>red
it renowned.</p>

<p>The genius of Espronceda was kindred to Byron’s, of whom
he has been accused of having been an imitator. But this
seems to me unquestionably a mistake. During his residence
in England he had certainly acquired a good knowledge of
the English language and literature, much to his advantage;
but he could scarcely have acquired such a knowledge of
either as to put him in the position of an imitator. The
utmost that can be alleged of him in this respect is, that
the style of Byron’s writing was so congenial to his own taste
and talent, as to make him imbibe it intuitively, and so obtain
a more decided character for his own than perhaps it
would have otherwise attained.</p>

<p>It is certain that Spanish poetry never before presented
such depth of thought and feeling, and such fulness and
vigour of expression, as he gave to it; and it is apparent, in
every page of his works, that he had studied in a higher
school and become imbued with a brighter inspiration than
he could have done on the Continent. But what ordinary
imitators would have considered the characteristics of Byron
as models to follow, he had the good sense entirely to discard.
He has none of the egotism and affectation which distinguish
that school; and if he indulged in some of its propensities, it
is clear that they were the natural results of the circumstances
in which he was placed, and not the wilful perversions of misdirected
abilities. His poem to Harifa is written with an
earnestness of feeling that must be felt, even through the
haze of translation, giving tokens of its origin too distinct
to admit any supposition of its being a suggestion from any
other source than his own experience of life. Neither in this
poem nor in any other of his works is there any of those
mysterious suggestions of dark histories, or of those morbid
denunciations of imaginary wrongs which abound in the pr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>oductions
of the Byronian school. His complaints are the
evident effusions of a mind maddened at finding itself in a
state unworthy of its powers, and thus, instead of venting his
rage on others, he turned it against his own misdeeds, in
giving way to excesses that he scorned, and which he felt
degraded him. But even in his aspirations for higher thoughts,
he had the same leaven of earth to keep him from attaining
them. He had not learned the lessons which Jovellanos
inculcated in the Epistle to Bermudez, to seek wisdom where
only it ought to be sought; as he might have done even from
the heathen poet, that the hidden things of God could not
be found out, though he were to traverse over all space in
search of them.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Ἀλλ’ οὐ γὰρ ἆν τὰ θεία, κρύπτοντος Θεοῦ,</div>
<div class="verse">Μάθεις ἆν, οὐδ’ εἰ πάντ’ ἐπεξελθοις σκότων.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In somewhat of the same strain with these lines is the
second canto of his poem, the ‘Diablo Mundo,’ addressed
to Theresa, which, however, has no connexion with the rest
of the poem to which it is attached. The verses ‘To a Star,’
contain also poetical thoughts no less exquisite, though perhaps
not of so decided a character; and they are all valuable
at least in this, that instead of gilding over vices and follies,
they show the confession of one so highly gifted by nature,
that the indulgences of sensual gratifications are in reality
only sources of unhappiness.</p>

<p>Two other of his poems, ‘The Mendicant’ and ‘The Executioner,’
are no less distinguishable for the power of thought
and expression they display; but they also unfortunately indicate
such objectionable tendencies, as to make us regret that
his extraordinary talents had not been directed to nobler
subjects. Not so the two poems selected for translation,
‘The Song of the Pirate,’ and that of the ‘Criminal Condemned
to Die,’ in addition to those previously mentioned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Of these, the latter is one of such peculiarly energetic character,
as to need no comment. The other is one of the most
favourite poems known in Spain, and having been set to
music, is therefore heard repeated more frequently. It has
been said to have been taken from the French, but I believe
erroneously. It bears strongly the impress of Espronceda’s
genius; and if the poem intended be either of those by Floran
or Victor Hugo, any one who will take the trouble of comparing
them will observe that they are essentially different,
as each also is from the song of Lord Byron’s ‘Corsair.’</p>

<p>At the first view of it, the ‘Diablo Mundo’ appears to be
an imitation of ‘Don Juan;’ but it would be as unjust to
declare it so, as to say the latter had been copied from the
various Italian poems written in the same style. Espronceda
might have had the idea suggested by reading Lord Byron’s
poem, or Goëthe’s ‘Faust,’ or both, but he has carried it
much higher, and given the outlines of a nobler conception
than either. He begins by supposing that, absorbed in meditation,
during the silence of the night, he hears an extraordinary
noise, which calls back his feelings and arouses them.
That confused noise, with sublime music and solemn sound,
are all the passions of the world, all the interests found in
life,&mdash;the affections and hatreds, love, glory, wealth, the vices
and the virtues; they are, in fine, the complaint of the whole
universe that comes like a revolving whirlwind, and displays
before the fancy a thousand allegorical monsters, traced with
inimitable facility and astonishing vigour.</p>

<p>The visions pass away, the noise goes gradually off, losing
itself in the distance, until it ceases, where begins the introduction
of the poem. The first canto is the exposition of
the great drama proposed to be developed.</p>

<p>A man bowed down with age and embittered <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>by sorrowful
and useless experience, shuts in despair a book he was reading,
and mournfully convinced of the barrenness of learning,
falls asleep. Death then presents itself, and intones a hymn
inviting him to the peace of the grave. With pleasure he
feels his benumbed limbs growing stiff with cold, and is
enjoying himself in the enervation of his spirit, when Immortality
suddenly rises up before him and sings another
hymn in opposition to that of Death, and like that also offering
herself to the man about to die.</p>

<p>The election is immediate; he chooses Immortality, and is
re-endowed with youth. The song of this deity, however,
does not lead to the immortality of the spirit, but of the
material part of man, and it is that he receives. The image
of death is invested with melancholy beauty; it is soft and
gentle; that which is desired when, free from prejudices, we
feel the heart worn and the soul discontented. The immortality
that rises over the pale front of death, effaces it with a
magnificent lustre. “It is impossible,” says Ros de Olano,
who has written the prologue to this beautiful poem, “to approach,
by any words of ours whatever, to the luxuriousness
of thought, of expression, and of knowledge displayed in this
sublime description, the most happy perhaps yet presented
in the Spanish language.” Grand, extended and immense is
the field which the poet has displayed to trace out a course
for his hero, and the variety of tones he employs are like the
face of the world, over which he has to range. As the character
is developed, the hero, with the body of a man and the
soul of a child, is placed in situations equally original and
interesting, and the whole scheme is one which gave full
scope to the writer for an unlimited work, even if he had
been permitted to live to the utmost period of human existence.</p>

<p>Del Rio states, that Espronceda was in his public discourses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
an ineffective speaker, and ascribes it to the physical
weakness of his frame; he describes him as having been
distinguished for sarcasms, and only at intervals powerful in
declamation. “In conversation he made an affectation of
laughing at the restraints and virtues which are necessary
for the order of society, and yet in private life no one was
more remarkable for kindness and generosity. When the
cholera was raging in Madrid, he was one of the most active
in disregarding its attacks, and in attending to the wants of
those near him who were suffering from it.” “All who knew
him loved him, and even to his faults he knew how to give a
certain impression of greatness.” Del Rio proceeds to describe
him as having been graceful in his bearing, endowed
with manly beauty, and his countenance marked with a melancholy
cast that rendered it more interesting. He concludes
by observing, that notwithstanding the years that
have passed since his friends had to lament his loss, a garland
of everlastings never fails to be found renewed over his
grave.</p>

<p>In 1848 Baudry published another edition of Espronceda’s
works, at Paris, but, with the exception of the fifth and sixth
cantos of the ‘Diablo Mundo,’ there is no additional poem
given, though Del Rio points out six other pieces published
in different periodicals. This omission is much to be regretted,
as undoubtedly every line that proceeded from his
pen was worthy of being gathered together as a rare treasure.
It is to be hoped that some admirer of his genius may soon
collect those scattered relics, and give them in an edition
worthy of their character in Spanish literature. Another Life
of him also would be most desirable, as in the Paris edition
there is only repeated the account given by Ferrer del Rio,
which, though ably written as a sketch, is still on the same
scale with a number of other writers in the same work of far
inferior merits, and utterly unworthy of so great a genius a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>s
Espronceda. Spanish versification under his influence has
become “revolutionized.” He has extended the powers apparently
even of the language itself, and by the force of his
style as well as by the varied character of his poems, has
certainly shown its capabilities more decidedly than any poet
who preceded him.</p>

<span class="smaller">JOSÈ ZORRILLA.</span></h3>

<p>It has been said that “the life of a poet is ever a romance.”
Perhaps this observation may apply equally well to the history
of every man of ardent genius who enters with characteristic
enthusiasm into the affairs of life, so as to invest even ordinary
circumstances with the glow and hue of his own excited imagination.
But this is more especially the case with poets who
make us participate in their feelings, their joys or their sorrows,
so as to give a character of romance to incidents that
with other persons would have passed away as unnoticed.
In the course of the preceding narratives, no doubt, many instances
may be remembered to verify this remark, and the
life of the eminent and deservedly popular poet with which
we have to close the series, even in his yet youthful career,
may be found to afford a further exemplification of it.</p>

<p>On the 14th February, 1837, a funeral car, over which
was placed a crown of laurel, had to traverse the streets of
Madrid, bearing to their resting-place in the cemetery, the
remains of the talented but wrong-minded Larra. The car
was followed by an immense concourse of mourners, principally
young men of the first classes of Madrid, who were so
testifying their regret for the loss they had sustained. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
whole scene presented a spectacle of homage paid to genius,
such as had seldom been witnessed. It was such as power
might have envied, and as worth scarcely ever attained. Melancholy
as had been the end of the unhappy being they
mourned, envy and hatred had become silenced, morality and
charity joined in regret, and no one disputed the propriety of
the funeral honours paid to the dead.</p>

<p>It was already late when the ceremonies were concluded,
and the darkening shadows of the night, in such a place and
on such an occasion, gave the countenances of all assembled
an extraordinary character. The shock they had felt, to lose
so suddenly from among them one so well-known to them
all, in the fulness of youth and intellect, in the height of
fame and popularity, without any apparent motive and enveloped
in mystery, was of itself sufficient to penetrate their
minds with sorrow. They felt that a bright light had been
extinguished, and they feared there was no hope of another
arising to shine in its place. A strange spell seemed to
have come over the bystanders, and they lingered round the
vault with an unaccountable disinclination to separate.</p>

<p>The eloquent Señor Roca de Togares, distinguished both
as an orator and a poet, pronounced a discourse he had
hastily prepared, in which he portrayed the general sensation
of sorrow, as he eulogized the talents and the principal
literary successes of the deceased. But his eloquence had
only the effect of exciting still further the prevalent feeling,
which was that of something still more appropriate being required
to give expression to their grief, and they instinctively
looked round for some one to give utterance to it in the language
of mournful inspiration with which to take their final
farewell.</p>

<p>At that m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>oment, in the midst of, it may be supposed,
almost painful silence, a young man, unknown to them, of a
slight figure and boyish appearance, stood forward, and with
a tremulous voice began reading some verses in unison with
their feelings, which at the first accents seemed to seize irresistibly
on the minds of the listeners. He was himself so
much affected by the scene, and perhaps under the sense of
his own temerity, that he could not finish his task, and Roca
de Togares took the paper out of his hands and read the
verses again audibly. Had they been possessed of only ordinary
merit, they would no doubt, on such an occasion, have
been favourably received; but expressed as they were in
highly poetical language, with appropriate sentiments, the
effect was to excite the utmost astonishment and admiration.
The author’s name, Josè Zorrilla, was eagerly called for and
repeated on all sides with loud applauses, and they who had
followed sorrowfully shortly before the remains of the man of
genius they had lost, now returned to the city attending in
triumph another poet they had found, with all the tokens of
enthusiastic rejoicing. The young poet, on his part, had
found an audience ready to welcome him, and he was at once
launched forth into that “tide in the affairs of men which
taken at the flood leads on to fortune.”</p>

<p>The history of the new aspirant for fame was now an object
of interest, and the public learned that he was the son of
Don Josè Zorrilla, a person well known as an eminent lawyer
who had held several judicial offices with credit in Spain. It
was while holding one of those offices, in Valladolid, that his
son, the subject of this narrative, was born there, the 21st of
February, 1817. From Valladolid, the father having been
promoted to other duties in Burgos, Seville, and finally at
Madrid, the son followed him, and received his primary education
in the various cities they inhabited, under circumstances
which must have operated powerfully on his mind.
On arriving at Madrid he was placed at the Seminary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Nobles, where he remained six years, thus giving that celebrated
institution the just merit of claiming him, as well as
so many others of the ablest writers and public men of Spain,
among those they had educated. There he seems to have
gone through his course of studies without apparently other
distinction than an early inclination to write verses and attend
the theatres, which predilection his tutors disapproved,
but in consideration of his father’s position passed over more
leniently than they otherwise would have done. This indulgence,
however, there is no doubt gave that decided turn to
his mind which led to his subsequent career.</p>

<p>On leaving the Seminary, Zorrilla had to go to his father
at his estate in the province of Castille, where he now lived
in retirement, having lost the favour of the government.
There soon a discordance rose between them as to his future
course in life. The father wished him to graduate in the
profession of the law, in which he had acquired wealth and
fame, and sent him, notwithstanding his repugnance, to Toledo,
to study in the university of that city. He passed accordingly
a year there, but with only sufficient application to
go through the ordinary routine respectably. Other studies,
more congenial to his taste, engaged all his thoughts. Toledo
is a city rich in historical and poetical remembrances
and legends. Its monuments and ruins are among the most
interesting that exist in Spain, and in the contemplation of
these Zorrilla was constantly absorbed. To Toledo he owed
his poetical education, as to it he has dedicated some of his
sweetest poetry. He shunned the society of his fellow-students,
and seemed to pass an eccentric and even mysterious
life. Out no one knew where, at strange hours, disregarding
the university rules and dress and etiquette, allowing his
hair to grow long over his shoulders, and composing songs, not
to the taste of his tutors, he was considered half-mad, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>d his
father was informed of his strange conduct as not amenable
to study and discipline. On going home for the vacation,
his father therefore received him with coldness and displeasure,
and made him read law with him, notwithstanding his
continued disinclination to it, though in secret he made
amends for the restraint by indulging in reading more agreeable
to himself. It is recorded more especially that he then
studied the Sacred Scriptures, in whose pages he found the
truest inspiration of poetry, as he certainly seems in his
writings generally to have imbibed the purest principles of
morality and religion.</p>

<p>In the hope of his entering on a more diligent course of
study at another place than Toledo, Zorrilla was then sent to
Valladolid, as if by changing universities he could be expected
to change the tendency of mind which urged him to his
destiny. There he was watched on all sides by his father’s
directions, and it was reported to him that his son still continued
his former course of conduct; that instead of passing
his hours in study, he was ever out on lonely walks, lying
under the shade of trees by the side of the river or the broken
rock, absorbed in his own meditations. There is a hint also
given, of even the discovery that he had found some dream
of youthful love to indulge in, as if it were something extraordinary
for one of his age and enthusiastic character. The
father must have been one of the class that Chateaubriand
suffered under, or Mirabeau; and happy it was for Zorrilla
that he did not sink into the recklessness of the one or the
inanities of the other, while he had also to submit to similar
discouragements. As it was, the father came to the conclusion
that no hope was to be entertained of his son’s application
to study, to take that position in the world which he had
planned out for him, and in which were centred all his own
ideas of honourable activity. He therefore resolved to ta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>ke
him from Valladolid, and sent a trusty messenger to bring
him home.</p>

<p>On the way the messenger gave Zorrilla to understand
that his father had resolved to employ him on his estate, to
dress the vines and perform other labours of country occupation.
It seems the father had even talked about fitting him
out in a labourer’s working garb, as not being calculated for
nobler employment, while he himself was unconscious or careless
of the wonderful power of mind which lay hid from his
observation in the son’s apparent inability to fulfil his expectations.
On this intimation, however, Zorrilla at once formed
his determination. Shortly before reaching home, he stayed
at the house of a relative, where he collected together the few
valuable things he could carry away, and appropriating to his
necessity a horse belonging to his cousin, he hastened back
to Valladolid. There he was fortunate enough to arrive and
sell the horse before the messenger sent after him again
could arrest him on his flight. He then transferred himself
without loss of time to Madrid, where for a length of time
he succeeded in escaping the vigilant search made for him
by his friends, who not having seen him since he was a boy,
were not able now to penetrate his disguise.</p>

<p>At Madrid under these circumstances, a fugitive from his
father’s house, he had now passed almost a year, when he
came forth before the public, as we have narrated, on the
occasion of Larra’s funeral. How he had passed those months
we are not informed further, than that he had to submit to
every kind of annoyances and privations, which he surmounted
by the firmness of his determination and the elevated character
of his hopes. He had in the interval sent several
pieces of poetry to the different periodicals, by which his
name had already become sufficiently known to a number of
those who hailed him on the 14th February as supplying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
place of the popular writer they had lost.</p>

<p>On the following day, Zorrilla could say, like Lord Byron,
that he awoke and found himself famous. The verses on
Larra were in every one’s mouth, and all others that could be
obtained of his writing were eagerly collected. Editors and
proprietors of periodicals were anxious to obtain his cooperation
for their works, and his period of difficulties had passed
away. Before the year closed, the first volume of his poems
appeared with an introduction by Pastor Diaz, and that was
so eagerly bought that he was induced to bring out others in
succession, with a prolificness unknown almost even in Spain.
Seven other closely printed volumes of his poems were published,
including several plays, within about three years afterwards,
and eight or nine other volumes have appeared since.
His works have been reprinted in Paris and in various parts
of Spanish America, and received everywhere with unbounded
admiration, so as at once to prove him one of the most
favourite poets that Spain has produced.</p>

<p>While he was thus rising to fame and competence, his
father, on the other hand, had fallen into misfortune. A high
prerogative lawyer, he had maintained the doctrines of absolutism,
and at length openly espoused the cause of Don
Carlos. On the failure of this prince’s attempts to gain the
throne, the elder Zorrilla, with other adherents, was proscribed
and had his property confiscated. His son had not
heard from him after this event for some years, when he received
a letter from his father from Bayonne, stating that he
was in difficulties, and requesting him to apply to a former
friend, whom he named, for a loan for his assistance. Zorrilla
wrote back to say that there was no occasion to incur an
obligation from one not related to him, and that he himself
was happy to have it in his power to send him the sum required,
which he would repeat at stated intervals. This he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
accordingly did, until he received his father’s directions to
discontinue it, as not requiring it any more.</p>

<p>Another instance of Zorrilla’s high-mindedness and true
Castilian pride has been recorded. On his father’s property
having been sequestrated by the government, it was intimated
to him that if he applied he might have the administration
of it, which was tantamount to giving him possession of it.
But he replied that he would neither apply for it nor accept
it, for while his father lived, he could acknowledge
no one else as entitled to it. His father having since died,
Zorrilla has come by law into possession of his estates, and
has thus had the rare fortune, for a poet, to be possessed of
considerable wealth. He has had several offers of appointments
from the government, but he has declined them, contented
to live according to his own fancies and occupied with
his own peculiar pursuits. His extraordinary facility for
composing verses is such as scarcely to allow his compositions
to be termed studies; but with them and his attendances at
the theatre, and other recreations, or at literary reunions,
he is said to pass away his hours in ease and contentment.
The first volume of his poems, it has been already intimated,
was published before he was twenty-one years of age. Within
three years afterwards seven others were published; and in
the eighth, to the poem of ‘The Duke and the Sculptor,’ was
appended the following note to his wife:&mdash;“Dedicated to the
Señora Matilda O’Reilly de Zorrilla. I began the publication
of my poems with our acquaintance, and I conclude them
with thy name. Madrid, 10 October, 1840.”</p>

<p>What were the circumstances attending this acquaintance
or union, we are not informed; but it is fortunate for the
world that the intimation it might convey of its being the
conclusion of his literary works has not been fulfilled. Since
then he has published ‘Songs of the Troubadour,’ in three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
volumes, and other minor poems and plays separately. A
larger work he meditated on the conquest of Granada, to be
entitled ‘The Cross and the Crescent,’ has not been completed;
and another he projected with the title ‘Maria,’ intending
to celebrate the different characters under which the
Holy Virgin is venerated in Roman Catholic countries, he has
published, with the greater part supplied by a friend, all very
inferior to what might have been expected from him.</p>

<p>It is much to be regretted that Zorrilla has in all his works
allowed carelessnesses to prevail, which too often mar the
effect of his verses, and still more that he has often inserted
some that were of very inferior merit compared with the rest.
It is not to be supposed that an author can be equally sustained
in all his productions, but it is somewhat extraordinary
in his volumes to find some poems of such transcendent merit,
and others so inferior. These, however, are very few, and
probably were hastily composed and hastily published, to
supply the demand arising for the day. He is probably the
only author in Spain who has profited by the sale of his
writings to any extent, and to do this he must have been
often under the necessity of tasking his mind severely, without
regard to its spontaneous suggestions. Thus then, when
he found his inspiration failing, he has often had recourse to
memory, and repeated from himself, and even from others,
verses previously published. It is to be hoped that he may
be induced soon to give the world a revised edition of his
works, in which the oversights may be corrected, and the
poems unworthy of his fame may be omitted.</p>

<p>On reading over dispassionately the ‘Lines to Larra,’ by
which he was first brought so prominently into notice, it
may occasion some surprise to learn they had produced so
remarkable an effect. If they had previously been read over
alone to any one of the auditors, he probably might not <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>have
considered them so ideal, so beautiful, or so original as they
seemed at the public recital. Some phrase might have appeared
incomprehensible, some sentiment exaggerated or not
true; some expression or line, hard or weak or forced. He
might have observed a want of order or connection in the
ideas, or the whole to be vague and leaving no fixed thought
in the mind; or he might have pronounced them, as they
have been since pronounced, an imitation of Victor Hugo or
Lamartine. But to the auditors assembled, in the excited
state of their feelings, there was no time for reflection or criticism.
It was a composition of the hour for that particular
scene,&mdash;for themselves, in language and feelings with which
they could sympathize. Thus the verses seized on their
minds and electrified them, so that they had no time to
dwell on any discussion or dispute of their merits, but yielded
at once to the fascination of the melodious verse they heard,
and the appropriate application of the homage they testified.</p>

<p>In the first volume of poems that Zorrilla published, containing
his earliest productions, are to be found all the selections
made for translation in this work. They may not be
so highly finished as some afterwards published, nor so
marked by that distinctive character he has made his own;
but they show the first promises of the fruit that was in
store, to be afterwards brought to such maturity. As he had
scarcely emerged from boyhood when he began to tread the
path to fame, his first steps could scarcely fail to betray that
sort of uncertainty which attends on all who are going on an
unknown road. Thus then through the volume he appears
to be seeking a ground whereon to fix his energies and build
the temple for his future fame, without being able confidently
to fix on any place in preference. His poetry from the first,
always sonorous and easy, often evidently spontaneous and
true to nature, at times is weak and deficient in the depth o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>f
thought that at other times distinguishes it, especially in the
compositions of a philosophic cast, which require fuller age
and reflection to give them with perfectness. Subject to these
remarks, independently of the poems hereafter given in the
translations, there are others, ‘To Toledo,’ ‘The Statue of
Cervantes,’ ‘The Winter Night,’ more clearly portraying the
peculiar character of his poetry as afterwards developed.</p>

<p>In the second volume published about six months afterwards,
he seems already to have taken his ground and to proceed
with a more decided step. The poem, ‘The Day without
Sun,’ is full of poetic vigour and richness of description,
and several tales of greater length and legendary character
show the bent of his mind and the direction it was in future
to take. In the third volume it was reserved for his genius
to be fully developed. It opens with a magnificent composition,
‘To Rome,’ in which deep philosophy and reflection are
combined with exquisite description, all so clear and distinct
as fully to captivate the mind and leave an impression of
complete satisfaction. But beyond this it contains the poem
‘To the last Moorish King of Granada, Boabdil the Little,’
which is generally considered his best. He was already recognized
as an admirable descriptive poet, but he now proved
his power of moving the inmost feelings to be as great as his
power of imagination. It is undoubtedly a splendid composition
and highly finished, so as to be well worthy of study
for the Spanish reader, though too long for translation for
this work. The same volume contains another poem, also
worthy of mention, ‘To a Skull,’ as written with much force
and effect, but in the style of the French imitators of Byron,
whom Zorrilla has too much copied, though it must be stated
without their affectation and exaggerations.</p>

<p>In the following volumes he continues the co<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>urse now so
markedly his own as a national poet. He avowedly chooses,
as becoming him in that character, subjects taken from the
traditions and legends current in Spain, and clothing them
in glowing language reproduces them to his delighted readers
as the dreams and remembrances of their youth. He is
especially partial to the tales connected with the Moorish
wars, and in so doing, with great poetic effect, always represents
the Moors in the most favourable light. Thus he
throughout makes them worthy rivals of the Christians, and
thereby renders greater the merit of the conquerors. The
richness of his diction is truly extraordinary, often so as to
make us lose sight of the paucity of ideas contained in his
poems, and that those again are too much the same repeated
constantly over.</p>

<p>If it was a wonderful and admirable triumph for one so
young to achieve by one bound the unqualified commendations
of his countrymen, and to sustain the success then acquired
by subsequent efforts, we have still to regret that
there were evils attending that precocity to prevent his attaining
apparently the highest excellence. Perhaps there is
no one we can point out as so truly exemplifying the maxim
“poeta nascitur.” He was truly born a poet; and though
he often writes showing that he had been reading Calderon or
some other of the elder writers of Spain, or even some of the
French poets, yet he always gives the colouring of his own
mind to those imitations so as to make them his own. This
often again leads him to a mannerism and repetition of himself;
but notwithstanding these faults or occasional errors of
carelessness, his compositions always remain uniformly and
irresistibly captivating.</p>

<p>Besides his poems, Zorrilla has published upwards of twenty
dramatic pieces, some of which have been repeatedly produced
on the stage with the fullest success. They are all remarkable
for the richness of versification and high tone of poetry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
which distinguish his lyrical compositions, and, like them, all
tend to honour and promote the chivalrous spirit for which
the Spanish nation has ever been renowned.</p>

<p>The modern poetry of Spain shows that her nationality is
still as distinct, her genius as elevated, and her sense of
honour as pure, as in any former period of her history. It
shows itself in unison with the spirit that has always animated
the people in their public conduct, in their loyalty and
devotion, the same now as a thousand years since, making
every hill a fortress and every plain a battle-field, to dispute
the ground at every foot with the enemy till they were
driven from their soil. The poets of Spain have still, as ever,
the most stirring tasks before them, to commemorate the
glories of their romantic country, and they are worthy of
their task.</p>

<h2 id="NOTES">NOTES.</h2>

<h3 id="note1">1. <a href="#Page_3">Page 3.</a> “Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos.”</h3>

<p>This name (pronounced Hovellianos) was formerly written as
two distinct names, Jove Llanos, as it is still by several members
of the family, one, an Advocate, at present at Madrid, and another
the Spanish Consul at Jamaica.</p>

<h3 id="note2">2. <a href="#Page_3">Page 3.</a> “An able and distinguished writer,” &amp;c.</h3>

<p>Antonio Alcalà Galiano, author also of the able article in the
Foreign Quarterly Review on Jovellanos, afterwards mentioned.
He was born at Cadiz, in 1789, the son of a distinguished officer
in the Spanish navy, who was killed at Trafalgar. In his youth,
Alcalà Galiano studied the English language so assiduously as to
receive much benefit from his knowledge of it when he had to
take refuge in London, on the various political changes that took
place in Spain. He then wrote much for the Westminster and
Foreign Quarterly Reviews, as well as other publications, and was
subsequently named one of the Professors of Languages in the
London University. Having returned to Spain, on the death of
Ferdinand VII., he was appointed a Minister of State, with the
Señor Isturitz, and has held, at various times, several high offices
in the government. In the Cortes he was considered one of the
most able orators of his time, having been put on a rivalry with
Martinez de la Rosa and Argüelles. He has published a few
poems, and contributed several valuable papers for the different
learned societies of Madrid, besides having written much for the
periodicals, according to the continental system for public men
seeking to disseminate their opinions. His principal work as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
author is a ‘History of Spain.’ Ferrer del Rio says of him, that
“he writes Spanish with an English idiom, and though he puts his
name to a history of Spain, it seems a translation from the language
of Byron.” Few foreigners have ever obtained so complete a knowledge
of the English language; in fact his writings in the several
reviews might be pointed out as compositions which would do
credit to our own best writers. As an instance of his knowledge
of the state of literature in England, we may quote a few observations
from an article bearing his name in the first number of the
Madrid Review. He says, “The Bible and the Plays of Shakespeare,
if they may be named together without profanation, are
the two works which have most influence on the thoughts of the
English;” adding, that “classical literature is there better cultivated
than in France, or at least cultivated with more profound
knowledge,” deducing the conclusion, “that the English drama
is consequently radically different from the French.”</p>

<h3 id="note3">3. <a href="#Page_11">Page 11.</a> “Bermudez, his biographer.”</h3>

<p>This industrious writer was born at Gijon, in 1749, and died at
Cadiz in 1829. He may be termed the Vasari of Spain, as the
historian of the artists of his country. His two biographical
works, the one on her painters, the other on her architects, are a
rich mine of materials. The former was published in six volumes
8vo, in 1800: the latter, in four volumes 4to, was almost the
last work on which he was engaged, and did not appear till 1829.
Besides these, he was the author of various other publications on
the principal edifices in Seville, and had completed a ‘History of
the Roman Antiquities in Spain;’ a ‘General History of Painting;’
a work on ‘Architecture,’ and other pieces, which yet remain unedited.
As a fellow-townsman, as well as an artist of considerable
genius, he was much assisted by Jovellanos, who, when Minister
of State, gave him a valuable appointment at Madrid under the
government. When that eminent individual fell, his friends had
to suffer also, and Cean Bermudez, deprived of his appointment,
had to return to Seville, where he instituted a school for dra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>wing.
It was no doubt under the feelings of regret, occasioned by the
reflection of having his friends involved in his misfortunes, that
Jovellanos wrote to him the Epistle selected for translation in this
work.</p>

of several friends to give the original of at least part or the whole
of some one poem of each author, from whose works the translations
have been made, selections of such as the English students
of Spanish literature would probably most desire, are offered for
their comparison.</p>

<p>This Epistle is addressed to his brother, as the reader may observe,
in the second person singular, which, in Spanish, has a tone
of more familiarity than in English, and understanding it so intended,
I have altered it, in the translation, into our colloquial
form of the second person plural.</p>

<p>The above extract is the same in his printed works of both editions;
but I have in my possession a collection of his manuscripts,
among which is a copy of this Epistle, with several variations, less
flattering to England. Had he lived to superintend the secon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>d
edition, these variations might probably have been adopted in it.
They are not, however, of any material variance, but they seem to
me to show that his eulogium had not been favourably received in
some quarters, and that he had therefore thought it prudent to
soften it in preparing for another edition. The publisher of the
edition of 1805 does not seem to have been aware of these manuscripts,
nor indeed to have taken the trouble of doing more for
Iriarte’s memory than merely to reprint the first edition, without
even any biographical or critical notice of him or his writings, as
he might well have done, Iriarte having been then deceased fourteen
years.</p>

<p>For another eloquent and encomiastic description of English
usages and institutions, the student of Spanish literature would
do well to read a work, published in London in 1834, by the
Marques de Miraflores, ‘Apuntes historico-criticos para escribir
la Historia de la Revolucion de España.’ This distinguished
nobleman was born the 23rd December, 1792, at Madrid, and
succeeded to the honours and vast property of his ancient house
in 1809, on the death of his elder brother, during the campaign
of that year. He has been much engaged in public affairs, having
held various offices in the state. He has been twice Ambassador
to England; the last time, Ambassador Extraordinary on the coronation
of Her Majesty Queen Victoria. The Marques has written
several works on political subjects, of which the one above-mentioned
is particularly deserving of study.</p>

translation into English has been made from the Spanish rather

<h3 id="note12">12. <a href="#Page_53">Page 53.</a> “Fables.”</h3>

<p>The Fables translated are numbered respectively III., VIII.,
XI., LIII. and LIV., in the original collection. The two
first, III. and VIII., having been given by Bouterwek as specimens
of Iriarte’s style, without any translation, I took them for
my first essays, and had already versified them, before finding
Roscoe had done the same also in his translation of Sismondi,
and it was subsequently to that I became aware of other similar
versions. Having, however, made those translations, I have, notwithstanding
the others, allowed them to remain in this work.
The fable of the Two Rabbits has been selected as particularly
noticed by Martinez de la Rosa, and the others almost without
cause of peculiar preference. The last one contains an old but
good lesson, which cannot be too frequently and earnestly repeated:&mdash;</p>

<h3 id="note13">13. <a href="#Page_64">Page 64.</a> “Iglesias and Gonzalez.”</h3>

<p>Diego Gonzalez was born at Ciudad Rodrigo in 1733, and died
at Madrid, 1794. Josè Iglesias de la Casa was born at Salamanca
in 1753, and died there in 1791. His poems were first published
seven years after his death, and have been several times reprinted.
The best edition is that of Barcelona, 1820, from which the one
of Paris, 1821, was taken. The poems of Gonzalez also were first
published after his death, and have been several times reprinted.
Both wrote very pleasing verses, and are deservedly popular in
Spain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="note14">14. <a href="#Page_69">Page 69.</a> “It was for his detractors,” &amp;c.</h3>

<p>Hermosilla, author of a work, ‘Juicio Critico de los principales
Poetas Españoles de la ultima era,’ published after his death,
Paris 1840, gives in it, as Mr. Ticknor pithily observes, “a criticism
of the poems of Melendez so severe that I find it difficult to
explain its motive;” at the same time that he gives “an unreasonably
laudatory criticism of L. Moratin’s works.” Hermosilla
appears to have been a man of considerable learning, but little
judgement. His criticisms are generally worthless, and the only
excuse for him, with regard to his book, is, that he did not publish
it. With regard to Melendez, taking every opportunity to depreciate
his merits, he is constantly found constrained to acknowledge
them, and sometimes even in contradiction to himself. Thus,
having several times intimated, as at p. 31, that the erotic effusions
of Melendez only were praiseworthy, he says, at p. 297,
when speaking of his Epistles, that they are “his best compositions;
thoughts, language, style, tone and versification, all in
general are good.” In another part he censures Melendez for
his poems addressed to different ladies, especially some to ‘Fanny,’
who appears to have been an Englishwoman; and yet those
epistles, addressed to her, on the death of her husband, are among
the purest and most elegant specimens that can be pointed out of
consolation to a mourner. It is but justice to his editor, Salva,
to say, that he has expressed his dissent from these criticisms,
though he thought proper to publish the work.</p>

<h3 id="note15">15. <a href="#Page_73">Page 73.</a> “The Duke de Frias.”</h3>

<p>This estimable nobleman, who died in 1850, was descended
from the Counts of Haro, one of the three great families of Spain.
He was the munificent friend of literary men, and in the case of
Melendez extended his protection to the dead, having taken much
personal trouble to have his remains removed from the common
burying-ground to a vault, where they might not afterwards be
disturbed. He also wrote verses occasionally, of which have <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>been
preserved, by Del Rio, a ‘Sonnet to the Duke of Wellington,’ and
by Ochoa, an ‘Elegy on the Death of his Duchess,’ whose virtues
will be found hereafter commemorated by Martinez de la Rosa.</p>

<h3 id="note16">16. <a href="#Page_76">Page 76.</a> “Best edition, that by Salvà.”</h3>

<p>In taking the edition of 1820 for the text, Salvà, in his edition,
has exercised much judgement in giving some of the poems as
they were originally published, rather than as Melendez afterwards
had left them, weakened by over-correction.</p>

<p>Salvà was in early life distinguished for learning and study,
having been, when only twenty years of age, named Professor of
Greek in the University of Alcalà de Henares. On the French
invasion he returned to his native city Valencia, and engaged in
trade as a bookseller, in which occupation he continued in London,
when obliged to emigrate hither in 1823, in consequence of his
having joined in the political events of the times. He had been,
during those events, Deputy from Valencia, and Secretary to the
Cortes. In 1830 he transferred his house to Paris, where he continued
his pursuits, publishing many valuable works of his own
compilation, as a Grammar and Dictionary of the Spanish language,
as well as editing and superintending the publication of
many other standard works. He closed his useful life, in his
native city, in 1850.</p>

<p>Works of Melendez, Salvà’s Edition, vol. i. p. 39.</p>

<p>This piece was also taken for translation from Bouterwek, when
first entering on a study of Spanish literature. From Bouterwek
it was copied by Sismondi, when borrowing, as he did largely,
from that compiler; but Mr. Roscoe has not given a translation
of this, as he probably found it difficult to do so satisfactorily. It
is in fact almost as difficult to translate Melendez as it is to translate
Anacreon, their peculiar simplicity and grace being so nearly
allied.</p>

<p>This poem having been particularly mentioned by Martinez de

may be considered best to be selected as an exemplification of it.
It is what is termed a Letrillia.</p>

<p>Mariano Josè de Larra was born at Madrid, 24th March, 1809.
His father had joined the French army as a medical officer, and
after the peace went to France, taking his son with him, where he
forgot his native language, so that he had to learn it as a novice
on his return to Spain. It is not improbable that his education
in that country, where also he passed some time subsequently,
gave Larra’s mind that tendency for scepticism and perverted
feeling which led to his miserable end. From his earliest years
he showed great aptitude for learning, and had studied the Greek,
English and Italian languages, before he went to Valladolid to
prepare for the profession of the law. After a short residence
there, he went to Valencia on some disappointment he suffered,
which, to one of his temperament, seemed a greater misfortune
than what perhaps any other person would have considered it.
At Valencia he obtained employment in a public office, which,
however, did not suit his taste, and having then married, he returned
to Madrid and determined to write for the public. His
first efforts were not successful, and have not been subsequently
reprinted with his works, but after a short time he began writing
a series of essays on passing events, under the signature of Figaro,
which at once attained great popularity. He also wrote several
plays and a few poems, which, as written by Figaro, were favourably
received. But the essays, under that title, were the foundation
of his popularity. They were in the style of our essayists of
the reign of Queen Anne, containing criticisms, and sketches of
manners and characters, written in a style of great ease and elegance,
marked with much wit and humour, as well as vigour.
These works have been very many times reprinted in Spain, and
also in France and South America. The student who wishes to
form a correct style in learning Spanish, cannot do better than
take Larra for a model. By his writings he had attained a respectable
place in literary society, and it was understood that his
fortunes were thereby also in a state of competence. He was,
however, possessed of an ill-regulated mind and headstrong passions,
so that, as it seems intimated, baffled in some object of unlawful
desire, he put an end to his existence by a pistol shot the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>

subscribes to all the sentiments therein expressed.</p>

<p>Of those who fell at Trafalgar, the names of Alcalà and Churruca
seem to be remembered with peculiar affection. The latter is referred
to by Arriaza also, and seems to have been an officer of
great skill and bravery in his profession, as well as of most amiable
qualities in private life. Alcalà was an officer of very superior attainments.
He was author of a learned Treatise on taking Observations
of Longitude and Latitude at Sea, published at Madrid,
1796. With the copy of this work in my possession, there is
bound up an unedited treatise of his original manuscript, ‘On the
Trigonometrical Calculation of the Height of Mountains.’ He
has already been referred to in Note 2.</p>

<p>The Spanish navy is at the present day much distinguished for
the superior attainments and character of the officers, as well as
in former years. In addition to the poet Arriaza, they have to
boast of the late learned Navarrete, one of the most eminent and
industrious writers of our times, principally on scientific subjects
connected with his profession, geography, hydrography, and voyages,
though in various biographical works he has extended his
labours to the memory of poets and others, as well as the naval
heroes of his country: see his memoir in Ochoa, vol. ii.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span> p. 586,

<p>The two poems from Quintana are at pages 16 and 93 respectively
of the fourth edition of his works, published in 1825.</p>

<p>This able and enlightened statesman was born at Oviedo in

and Revolution of Spain,’ is one well deserving of the fame it has
attained, having been translated into all the principal languages of

<p>Born at Ecija, near Seville, in 1808, he came to Madrid in 1833,
and was admitted an Advocate in the courts of law, but has been
since engaged actively in conducting various publications, principally
of a political character. He has been several times chosen
member of the legislature, and had to undertake his share of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
public duties, but he has declined office, and in his whole public
life shown a freedom from ambition, remarkable, as Del Rio intimates,
from the contrast it presents with the conduct of other
men of far inferior abilities. He has announced ‘A History of
the Regency of Queen Christina,’ of which he has published a
preliminary volume, comprising a detail of antecedent events. He
has also written various plays and poems, but not of such a character
as to be worthy of his fame as a public speaker and journalist.
His life of Martinez de la Rosa, given in a publication
entitled ‘Galeria de Españoles celebres contemporaneos, 1842,’
(which work has now extended to many volumes, including persons
of distinction in all ranks of life,) is very pleasingly written,
and has been taken as the principal authority in this compilation.</p>

<p>Works of Martinez de la Rosa, edition of Barcelona, 1838, vol. iv.
p. 1. The other translations are taken from the same, pages 113,
104, 48 and 34 respectively.</p>

<p>In the prologue, he enters on the discussion, so common a few
years since, as to the relative merits of what were called the Classical
and Romantic schools of poetry, which discussion, it is to be
hoped, may now be considered at an end. The pretensions of
different writers, who affected to range themselves under one or
other of these denominations, were in fact generally only the devices
of mediocrity to shelter their deficiencies. Those who write
spontaneously from the true inspiration of genius, will never submit
to the shackles of any system, and for all writers the wisest
aim is to seek the clearest style of expressing those thoughts
which they have to convey. As Martinez de la Rosa has well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
observed in this prologue, “I do not remember any one sublime
passage, in whatever language it may be, that is not expressed
with the utmost simplicity; and without this most essential
quality, they cannot excite in the mind that lively and instantaneous
impression which distinguishes them.”</p>

<h3 id="note35">35. <a href="#Page_184">Page 184.</a> “The light foot that never stirs,” &amp;c.</h3>

<p>An Andalusian poet may be excused entering into hyperbolical
praise of his countrywomen, but we find an English traveller
almost as hyperbolical in praise of them also. “It is beyond the
power of language to describe those slow and surpassingly graceful
movements which accompany every step of the Andalusa; her
every attitude is so flowing, at the same time so unforced, that
she seems upborne by some invisible power that renders her independent
of the classically moulded foot she presses so lightly on
the ground.”&mdash;<cite>Murray’s Cities and Wilds of Andalusia.</cite></p>

<h3 id="note36">36. <a href="#Page_216">Page 216.</a> “His biographer, Pastor Diaz,” &amp;c.</h3>

<p>In the work already mentioned, ‘Galeria de Españoles contemporaneos,’
under his own superintendence, and from which the
notices in this compilation are principally taken. Pastor Diaz
was born at Vivero in Galicia, in the year 1811, and was educated
at Alcalà de Henares. Having been admitted an Advocate in the
courts of law, he engaged, in 1833, in the public service, and has
held various offices under the government in the provinces. In
1847 he published a volume of poems, of which two,&mdash;one, ‘The
Black Butterfly,’ and the other, an ‘Ode to the Moon,’&mdash;Ochoa
declares, in his opinion, “two of the most beautiful pieces that
have been written for many years in Spain.” Disagreeing very
much with this opinion, it is only quoted in token of the estimation
in which Pastor Diaz is held among his countrymen. (Ochoa,
vol. ii. p. 628.)</p>

<h3 id="note37">37. <a href="#Page_216">Page 216.</a> “The advantages he enjoyed there.”</h3>

<p>In his poem of the ‘Moro Esposito,’ the Duke has inserted an
interesting episode referring to his residence in Malta, “whose
good and honest inhabitants he found under the dominion of the
most wealthy, free, enlightened, noble and powerful nation that
the sun admires from the zodiac.” (Book VI.) In the notes he details
the particulars under which he arrived there, acknowledging
gratefully the hospitality he had received.</p>

<h3 id="note38">38. <a href="#Page_222">Page 222.</a> “Pedro, surnamed the Cruel.”</h3>

<p>This name is pronounced Ped-ro. The true character of the
monarch is yet a disputed question, and has only within the last
year been offered as a subject for inquiry by the Spanish Academy.
The learned Llorente, in his ‘Historical Notices,’ vol. v., has, I
think, clearly shown that Pedro was no more deserving of the
epithet peculiarly than others of his age, including his half-brother
and successor, by whose hand he fell, in retributive justice for the
death of their other brother Fadrique. The legend of this prince’s
death has been variously given, and thus Salvador Bermudez de
Castro, who has also a poem on the subject, takes some different
details to those repeated by the Duke de Rivas. The traditions
of the people have handed down Don Pedro’s memory more
favourably, and, perhaps, more justly, than the historians of the
time, whose accounts no doubt were tinctured as darkly as they
could be, partly to please the reigning monarch, and partly because
Don Pedro had not been so submissive to priestly rule as
they had desired.</p>

<p>This romance was originally printed with the ‘Moro Esposito,’
Paris 1834, vol. ii. p. 451. It was subsequently included among
the ‘Romances Historicos,’ Madrid 1841, p. 19. The Alcazar
of Seville has been described by so many travellers that it is unnecessary
to add to their accounts of it, or to the graphic details of
the romance. The stain on the floor may remind the reader of the
legends of Holyrood and the Alhambra, as well as of other places.</p>

<p>The two brothers of Fadrique, of whom Henry was his successor
on the throne, after he had killed Don Pedro in fight by his own
hand. In another romance, the Duke de Rivas describes this
“fratricide,” and represents that Don Pedro had the advantage
at first, but that the page of the other came to his master’s
assistance, and attacking Don Pedro from behind, diverted his attention
so as to enable him to give the King the death-wound.
From the accounts handed down to us, it is clear that Don Pedro
had sufficient grounds for suspecting treason from the brothers,
which occasioned his animosity against them and their adherents,
for which they afterwards blackened his memory.</p>

<p>The selections from Breton de los Herreros are taken from the

<h3 id="note45">45. <a href="#Page_269">Page 269.</a> “The celebrated Lista.”</h3>

<p>This celebrated writer was born at Seville in 1775, and in early
life adopted the ecclesiastical profession, having therein principally
dedicated himself to the education of youth, in which he has been
eminently successful. He has written a continuation of Mariana’s
‘History of Spain,’ and translated from the French Segur’s ‘Universal
History,’ besides several mathematical and other elementary
works. In 1822 he published a volume of poems, of which a
second edition has been since published, highly praised by the
different writers who have treated of modern Spanish literature.
They are however avowedly of the classical school, and their
greatest merit must be supposed to consist in their elegance of
expression. His critical writings are numerous and valuable.</p>

<h3 id="note46">46. <a href="#Page_271">Page 271.</a> “Twelve out of the nineteen stanzas.”</h3>

<p>The stanzas 6, 9, 10, 11, 16 and 17 seem to be of his addition,
and it must be acknowledged that they are in no respect inferior
to the others. One stanza in Pindemonte he has not taken into
his version.</p>

<h3 id="note47">47. <a href="#Page_272">Page 272.</a> “Part of his first volume is taken up with
imitations.”</h3>

<p>Before observing that this part had been so expressed at the
beginning, I made a translation of one small piece, which may
give an idea of the others.</p>

‘The Condemned to Die,’ El Reo de Muerte, literally, ‘The
Guilty of Death,’ has the signification given to this phrase by our
translators of the New Testament, and it may be necessary to explain
that the refrain “Your alms for prayers,” &amp;c., is in the
original merely “To do good for the soul of him who is about to
be executed.”</p>

<p>The name of this eminently great poet is to be pronounced as
Thorrillia; the translations made from his works are of the poems
at pages 62, 99, 34, 97, 102, 28 and 65, respectively, of the first
volume, as stated in the memoir, published at Madrid in 1837.
The headings, for the sake of distinction, have been given somewhat
differently from the originals, where they are generally only
entitled ‘Oriental,’ or ‘A Romance;’ and the piece named ‘The
Warning’ is but part of a longer poem, the conclusion of which
is not in the same good taste as the beginning. All the other
selections translated in this work, of the different authors, have

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
